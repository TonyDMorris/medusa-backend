He is particularly inspired by the simplicity and boldness of stripes, citing Morris Louis (Bernstein), Barnett Newman and Agnes Martin as influences.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Viewers may recognise elements of the Colour Field genre in Alex&amp;rsquo;s paintings. This emerged in New York City in the 1940s and 1950s and is characterised by sections of solid, flat colour and an emphasis on overall consistency and form.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alex says: &amp;ldquo;I was the weird kid who went to an art museum instead of a playground. At ten years old, I fell in love with stripes. They are an iconic, graphic machine in our consciousness and in the world of art, appealing to us all at some instinctual level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Alex Echo&#039;s latest artworks\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Alex_Echo\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Shop the Alex&#039;s latest artworks here.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Alex Echo &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Combining art history with references to popular culture and iconography, Alex&#039;s creations are inventive, informative and accessible. A harmony of colour, light, movement and emotion, his paintings depict a striking visual narrative that lifts the spirit of the viewer. He has no formal training, and instead relies on his instincts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The mix of resin and matt finish allows the viewer to explore the intricate process beneath.

One or the other!\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He works from his studio at his home in Surrey, where he enjoys a full English breakfast twice per week.

No detail goes unnoticed, from the gentle curve of a chimpanzee&amp;rsquo;s fingertips to the majestic mane of a lion. This incredible focus and gift for capturing startling moments is, in Alfie&#039;s own words, a result of his autism, which has had a profound effect on the young photographer&#039;s life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As explored in his &lt;a title=\&quot;Watch the An Eye for Detail documentary trailer on YouTube\&quot; href=\&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qmedKOzqQ0M&amp;amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Eye For Detail &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;documentary, Alfie&#039;s artistic vision is shaped by a meticulous attention to detail and an unwavering determination to prove people wrong. Since receiving his first DSLR camera as a Christmas gift in 2015, Alfie has tirelessly honed his craft. Once alienated by his peers, Alfie found an affinity to animals that guided him through his darkest moments. As a child, he sought solace in wildlife magazines and documentaries, now as an adult his work has been featured by BBC Earth and is lauded by celebrities including Sir David Attenborough.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alfie&#039;s photography is noted for the &#039;tenderness of his soul and the sharpness of his mind&#039;, with &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Magazine&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;stating that &#039;as Alfie bares his soul through his lenses, in return they [the animals] bare theirs&#039;. Visiting zoos across the UK, Alfie waits for hours - sometimes days - to capture the perfect shot, and believes that photographing in black and white allows him to focus on the personality of his chosen animal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Featured by titles including the &lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Evening Standard&lt;\/em&gt;, Alfie&#039;s inspiring story has also seen him work alongside charities to raise awareness for wildlife and autism. He was also a judge for the&amp;nbsp;Creative Earth art competition, held in collaboration with WWF and the UN climate change conference COP26. In 2021, he was&amp;nbsp;appointed as a Nikon Z Creator, which saw him explore the brand&#039;s new mirrorless system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alfie, who released his &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Wild World: Nature through an Autistic Eye by Alfie Bowen\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/alfie-bowen\/wild-world-nature-through-an-autistic-eye\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first book&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; in September 2021, says:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;After many years of social exclusion as a result of my autism, I have finally found my calling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;\/em&gt; celebrates the results of a ten-year journey from bullied teenager to renowned artist.

Quickly sketching out these ideas, he keeps these as references when photographing out in the field, not stopping until the image captured by his camera film is as spectacular as the one in his mind.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His photographs are taken at zoos across the UK, following careful research into his chosen species. Alfie explains: &amp;ldquo;It is important to know the behaviour of your subject and to be aware of the images that already exist &amp;ndash; there is no room for the mundane.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It is a meticulous process: Alfie must gain the trust of the animals to capture them in a natural pose. Luckily, patience and persistence come naturally to the photographer, who credits his autism for his astonishing attention to detail. He adds: \&quot;Autism helps me visualise what I want to capture, and gives me the determination and the obsession to create that.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alfie dreams of one day visiting India and Africa to photograph animals in their natural habitats. He says: &amp;ldquo;People tend to care more for the things they love; I hope to make people fall in love with our natural world, so we can save it before it&amp;rsquo;s too late. We share planet Earth with many other species and it is our responsibility to care for them and ensure that they are thriving for future generations to enjoy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about Alfie&#039;s artistic process in our &lt;a title=\&quot;Read our Alfie Bowen brochure online\&quot;

He has also appeared in over 50 films, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2014),&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lemony Snicket&amp;rsquo;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2004),&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Last Samurai&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2003),&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Brown&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/em&gt;(1997) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Indecent Proposal&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1993).&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It was on a rainy day in 2007 that Billy first put pen to paper. Taking refuge from the grey drizzle of Montreal, Canada, he entered an art shop with a twinkling curiosity and left with an armful of supplies and the urge to create. Back in his hotel room, his felt-tips and sketchbook formed a portal for his imagination, and over the next five years his drawings evolved into his debut fine art collection, &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Billy Connolly&#039;s limited edition art\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Billy_Connolly\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Born On A Rainy Day&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;which launched in 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Explaining his flexible approach, Billy says: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s lovely, the way people think you do it. People think I paint or draw things on purpose. I don&amp;rsquo;t, I just draw. And then as it goes on, it becomes obvious what it&amp;rsquo;s going to be (to me). And then I can think about it along those lines: a horse, a man or a balloon. That&amp;rsquo;s when I name it &amp;ndash; at the end.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Billy&#039;s art has been likened to the cave paintings of the Aurignacian period (40,000-25,000 BC), which are characterised by their linear, one-dimensional approach. Charmingly simplistic, his faceless figures possess an extraordinary self-awareness and humanity. Devoid of emotion or expression, their anonymity opens them up to individual interpretation, creating a unique bond with the viewer. In 2020, he released his first sculpture, followed by two more in 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An admirer of artists like Ren&amp;eacute; Magritte and David Hockney, Billy has made an impact on the art world beyond his own creations. In 2017, the newly knighted Sir Billy Connolly was immortalised in three 50ft murals in his hometown of Glasgow to celebrate his 75th birthday, with his infamous &amp;lsquo;banana boots&amp;rsquo; later displayed at the People&amp;rsquo;s Palace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, following his retirement from stand-up comedy, he starred in the ITV documentary &lt;em&gt;Billy Connolly: It&#039;s Been a Pleasure&lt;\/em&gt;, in which he detailed what his art means to him. After winning the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Edinburgh TV Festival, in September 2021, Billy was immortalised in LEGO&amp;reg; bricks for a series of limited edition minifigures. The five &amp;lsquo;Wee Big Yins&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; comprising the Musician Yin, the Funny Yin, the Biker Yin, the Actor Yin and the Artist Yin &amp;ndash; represent Billy&amp;rsquo;s different career stages, with all proceeds going towards Glasgow Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Charity. Billy described it as a highlight of his career, adding: &amp;ldquo;To be a Lego man is amazing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In October 2021, he released his first autobiography, &lt;em&gt;Windswept &amp;amp; Interesting&lt;\/em&gt;. The Waterstones Exclusive Edition features his new &#039;Teddy Boy&#039; inspired graphic, which depicts a stylish musician with maracas. His Christmas collection was released in November 2021. In March 2022, he released the eighth instalment of &lt;em&gt;Born On A Rainy Day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Born On A Rainy Day collection \&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Billy_Connolly\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop available artworks from Billy Connolly here&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:138,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Billy Connolly &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Now living in Florida, Billy creates art in his home studio.&amp;nbsp;In recent years, he has embraced colour, adding: &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s more colour in the collection than before. I was looking at the drawings and sometimes they were crying out for colour and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why. It was a kind of question. So I put it off for ages and then started to dribble a little colour in. And once you&amp;rsquo;ve put it in, you&amp;rsquo;re kind of stuck with it &amp;ndash; you have to put other colours in. It ended up different from the way it started out &amp;ndash; it had a totally different attitude to it.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Colour is weird. A little goes a long way, and if you go too far, it looks like a children&amp;rsquo;s drawing &amp;ndash; not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with children&amp;rsquo;s drawings, they&amp;rsquo;re delightful &amp;ndash; but it takes away the melancholy. I like the melancholy in the drawings. I don&amp;rsquo;t know sometimes what the melancholy is drawing on, or what it&amp;rsquo;s about. The colour tends to cheer it up and then make it a big exposure. So I don&amp;rsquo;t know quite what it&amp;rsquo;s about, but I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying doing it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Billy has also explored sculptures, with five designs now under his belt.&amp;nbsp;Created from Billy&#039;s original drawings, they were cast in metal to reflect his past as a welder in the Glaswegian shipyards, and each sculpture features a cast of Billy&#039;s signature to signify his approval throughout the design process.&amp;nbsp;The original sculptures were created in clay, with Billy&#039;s detailed lines and patterns recreated by a specialist atelier team before being cast in stainless steel. The effects of light and shade, also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;chiaroscuro&lt;\/em&gt;, are highlighted by the ridges and the reflection of light.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For behind-the-scenes videos of Billy and a sneak peek at his home, head over to our YouTube channel &lt;a title=\&quot;Follow us on YouTube for Billy Connolly videos and updates\&quot; href=\&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3bMVdiEsiY8&amp;amp;list=PLrXCYs1aZ9KbCmHmtfqLEfVB33Cx9M7Zd\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vrr5kU717QY&amp;list=PLrXCYs1aZ9KbCmHmtfqLEfVB33Cx9M7Zd&amp;index=5&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10646,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10650,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;BCN&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6957,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:131,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;billy-schenck&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-10-19 13:21:31&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-05-16 15:10:40&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Billy Schenck &quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Fusing cinematic culture, modern-day cowgirls and tongue-in-cheek humour, Billy Schenck &amp;ndash; also known as the &amp;lsquo;Warhol of the West&amp;rsquo; takes viewers on an exhilarating trek through Western mythology.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;banner_id&quot;:11900,&quot;meta_title&quot;:&quot;About Billy Schenck &quot;,&quot;meta_description&quot;:&quot;Discover more about &#039;Warhol of the West&#039; Billy Schenck at Castle Fine Art&quot;,&quot;meta_keywords&quot;:&quot;Billy Schenck, Billy Schenck art, Billy Schenck Castle Fine Art, Billy Schenck Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol Castle Fine Art, American art, cowboy art, Western pop art, pop art, USA art, art free delivery USA, art free delivery UK, Castle Fine Art free deliver&quot;,&quot;opengraph_id&quot;:null,&quot;thumbnail_id&quot;:11898,&quot;born&quot;:&quot;Ohio&quot;,&quot;lives_and_works&quot;:&quot;Santa Fe, New Mexico &quot;,&quot;education&quot;:&quot;Columbus College of Art and Design, Kansas City Art Institute &quot;,&quot;awards&quot;:null,&quot;exhibitions&quot;:&quot;Briscoe Western Art Museum, Smithsonian Institute, Denver Art Museum&quot;,&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;No other genre in the last 200 years can compete.&quot;,&quot;quote_image1_id&quot;:11901,&quot;quote_image2_id&quot;:11902,&quot;quote_image3_id&quot;:11903,&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;video_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio-born artist is inspired by both black-and-white stills of Hollywood Westerns and the Pop Art style of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Greek mythology clashes with irony, apocalyptic imagery and sexual tension for a collection that brazenly expands the limits of the genre.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bringing his art to the UK for the first time ever in November 2018, the real-life ranch sorting world champion exposed viewers to a reimagined Western narrative. His work is characterised by its scorching colour palette, surreal juxtapositions and cinematic composition &amp;ndash; which creates what &lt;em&gt;Southwest Art&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine terms &amp;lsquo;a stance&amp;hellip;a pendulum between the romantic and the irreverent&amp;rsquo;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a nod to Andy Warhol &amp;ndash; with whom Billy shared a retrospective exhibition at the Briscoe Western Art Museum in 2018 &amp;ndash; the artist has been titled the founder of the Western Pop Art movement. With the legend of the cowboy continuing to live on in the popular imagination, Billy shows the sun is not yet ready to set on the Western genre.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Billy says: &amp;ldquo;I wanted to do with my paintings what Sergio Leone had done with film. No other genre in the last 200 years can compete. It has a timeless quality, and still has infinite possibilities to explore.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Billy Schenck &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;With accomplished use of chiaroscuro, Billy projects photographs from Western movie stills and fills the outlines with flat, hard-edged areas of colour. This, in his own words, produces &amp;ldquo;a perfect marriage of photorealism and a paint-by-number system&amp;rdquo;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His fiery horizons and landscapes are formed from distinct geographical locations and his childhood memories of summers spent in the high deserts of Wyoming. This curious mixture of real and imaginary, past and present is what defines the Kansas City Art Institute graduate. Through his exploration of mythical Western archetypes &amp;ndash; including the lonesome cowboy and stoic Native American &amp;ndash; Billy both celebrates and pokes fun at the subject.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:12455,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:12456,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;BSC&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:11899,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:256,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;bisaillon-brothers&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2019-10-14 12:40:58&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2023-01-19 15:25:22&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bisaillon Brothers&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Art certainly runs in the family for Jeffrey and Michael Bisaillon.

Their grandfather was a landscape and wildlife painter, with his brother an illustrator for Disney. Whilst at Catholic school, the brothers were encouraged by nuns to work on art projects.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After moving into an empty house with bare walls, Jeffrey and Michael decided to create their own art to hang, sparking a collaboration that has made waves since 2012. Their work has taken them around the world, including a sell-out show in Miami and exhibitions in the Netherlands and Great Britain.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Influenced by artists like Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, the duo evoke an exciting commentary on the pop culture of today and the mid-20th century. New technology, iconicism, globalisation and social media are given a modern interpretation through digital art, vibrant colours and bold brushwork.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The pair told ArtExpo New York: &amp;ldquo;With the invention of the digital process, art is once again undergoing a massive evolution that is taking creativity to an even higher level. We believe artists should use all of the amazing tools available today and combine them with the processes from the past.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;The Bisaillon Brothers&#039; latest artworks\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Bisaillon_Brothers\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener\&quot;&gt;Shop the Bisaillon Brothers&#039; latest artworks here.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:158,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of the Bisaillon Brothers&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The brothers have a unique, hands-on approach to creating their art.

His childhood memories &amp;ndash; including riding scooters with his friends and walking home from school to the mill where his mother worked as a weaver &amp;ndash; influence his industrial scenes, which feature themes of work, love and friendship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Elements of his work can be likened to those of some of Britain&amp;rsquo;s most important artists. His factories and smoking chimneys echo L.S. Lowry&amp;rsquo;s industrial landscapes, while his street scenes and figurative tableaus may resonate with fans of Harold Riley. Similarly to the Polish-British painter Josef Herman, Bob focuses on the working-class, celebrating the bonds that can be created through shared experiences.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bob&#039;s family are central to his work, with his grandchildren inspiring some of his characters. Another inspiration is the light he believes is unique to the north of England. Where others see soot-blackened brick and polluted skies, Bob sees light and colour; capturing a warm glow in the moonlight, windows and streetlamps. He explains: &amp;ldquo;When I paint, it&amp;rsquo;s almost as if this northern light pours from my brush onto the canvas. It transforms everything it touches, from the cobbled streets to the terraced houses, mills and back alleyways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create his atmospheric scenes, Bob uses traditional techniques, including &lt;em&gt;sfumato&lt;\/em&gt;. Often seen in Renaissance paintings, this involves softening the transition between colours so they appear to evaporate like smoke. Artistic influences also include the Victorian landscape painter John Atkinson Grimshaw, the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt, the German Renaissance artist Albrecht D&amp;uuml;rer, and the English Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Bob has experimented with different styles and mediums, including personalisable prints, sculptures and circular compositions. He has also begun to incorporate more colour through details such as raincoats, balloons and his signature motif of two red hearts. Exhibited at institutions like Leeds City Museum, his heartwarming artworks have raised money for charities such as the Jo Cox Foundation and One In A Million, establishing him as one of Britain&amp;rsquo;s best-loved artists.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His new collection and first-ever hardback book, collectively titled &lt;a title=\&quot;From Yesterday to Here | Bob Barker\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/from%20yesterday%20to%20here\/artists\/Bob_Barker\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Yesterday to Here&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;, celebrates 15 years with our publisher, Washington Green. Bob says: \&quot;The safe, warm feeling of revisiting childhood memories through adult eyes is what keeps me in front of the canvas. This is not just something I love, or want to do: I have to paint.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the latest art from Bob Barker\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Bob_Barker\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Shop Bob&#039;s latest limited edition prints here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:144,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Bob Barker &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Bob has always lived in Yorkshire, and continues to draw inspiration from his surroundings. He explains: \&quot;Where I live, it is impossible to walk a dozen yards from home without seeing old weavers&amp;rsquo; cottages, cotton and woollen mills, Yorkshire stone flags or cobbled streets that have been there for decades, watching the landscape change around them. Every day I get to see and paint this history, and people get to share it with me through my paintings. How wonderful is that?\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The idea for Bob&#039;s signature heart motif developed after he began doodling umbrellas and noticed a heart shape taking form. Following this, he asked his son and daughter-in-law to pose for him. While the concept started as an experiment, it now represents a feeling of togetherness, with Bob adding: \&quot;Life takes us to unexpected places, but it is love that brings you home.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The glaze of his original oil paintings is inspired by the Old Masters of the Renaissance period. Techniques include &lt;em&gt;grisaille&lt;\/em&gt;: a method used by artists such as the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, whereby neutral tones or shades of grey create the illusion of sculpture. He has also mastered &lt;em&gt;sfumato&lt;\/em&gt;, which softens the transition between colours so that they appear to evaporate like smoke. By using &lt;em&gt;repoussoir&lt;\/em&gt;, he paints objects in the near foreground to lead the viewer&#039;s eye into the painting and enhance the depth, light and perspective of the piece.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Describing his painting process, Bob says: \&quot;Before I squeeze the first drop of oil onto my palette, I sit and gaze at the blank canvas, sometimes for quite a while. With music always playing in the background, I visualise the composition, change the colour of the sky, nudge buildings into new locations, make it rain and many more combinations until I am happy. I then make a few very quick lines on the canvas, just to set the scene, because by now I am impatient to get some paint on the canvas.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;When the initial painting is dry, I usually rework it by applying glazes (thin washes of oil paint that allow the colour of the underpainting to show through), either to the whole canvas or to individual areas, thus creating intense contrasts for luminosity and depth.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

A few drawings reached the public gaze with album covers like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Music from Big Pink&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1968) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Self Portrait&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1970). In 1974, Dylan spent two seminal months studying art with Ashcan School tutor Norman Raeben, who philosophised the importance of &#039;perceptual honesty&#039; - painting life as it as seen, not imagined.&amp;nbsp;Dylan says of this time: \&quot;He put my mind and my hand and my eye together, in a way that allowed me to do consciously what I unconsciously felt.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The artist&amp;rsquo;s journeys between cities and towns are personified by his Expressionist lines, which capture the instant moment of a place, person and time. Repeated motifs encourage the viewer to explore the depths of colour and the evolution of his work.&amp;nbsp;His art has been likened to that of Pablo Picasso, with critics applauding the relatability of his collections. He paints mostly from life, stating: \&quot;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much interested in people, histories, myth, and portraits; people of all stripes.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, the &lt;em&gt;Bob Dylan: Retrospectrum&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;exhibition opened at the Patricia &amp;amp; Phillip Frost Art Museum in Miami, where it ran until April 2022. Following a successful tour in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, the display spanned six decades and was the largest exhibition of Dylan&#039;s work to ever be displayed in the United States.&amp;nbsp;Featuring over 180 paintings, drawings and ironworks from throughout his artistic career, it also included Dylan&#039;s brand-new&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Deep Focus&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;series, which transforms scenes from films into cinematic paintings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:10958,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:46369,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:6389,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:6388,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:10959,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Dylan&amp;rsquo;s contributions to worldwide culture have been recognised and honoured with many awards. These include an Academy Award for his song &#039;Things Have Changed&#039;, which featured in the 2000 film &lt;em&gt;Wonder Boys&lt;\/em&gt;, along with 12 Grammy Awards and a Special Citation Pulitzer Prize for his &#039;profound impact on popular music and American culture&#039;. Further accolades include a Kennedy Center Honor presented by former president Bill Clinton, the Presidential Medal of Freedom presented by former president Barack Obama, and the Nobel Prize in Literature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;During the last six decades he has released more than 50 albums and written in excess of 500 songs, some of the most famous being &amp;lsquo;Blowin&amp;rsquo; In The Wind&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;The Times They Are A-Changin&lt;a title=\&quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#039; by Bob Dylan\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/mondo-the-times-they-are-a-changin\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Like A Rolling Stone&amp;rsquo;, which were visually reimagined for the first time in his &lt;em&gt;Mondo Scripto&lt;\/em&gt; collection.

The exhibition presented a selection of Bob Dylan&amp;rsquo;s most iconic songs, handwritten in pen on paper and accompanied with a corresponding drawing in graphite, also on paper. As Tom Piazza, a celebrated novelist and writer on American music, writes in the introduction to the exhibition catalogue, &#039;Dylan&amp;rsquo;s restlessly creative mind is never wholly satisfied, and those familiar with these songs will find surprise at many a new turn of phrase. The unexpected couplings of these works and images offer a surprisingly intimate door into each song, adding dimension, delight and insight into the artist&amp;rsquo;s relation to his own work.&#039;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2019&lt;\/strong&gt;: A landmark retrospective exhibition,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retrospectrum&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;, featuring Dylan&amp;rsquo;s artistic output to date opened at MAM Shanghai, before beginning a tour that will cover Asia, Europe and the USA.

These include crushed glass, gold and silver leaf, marble, bronze and glass diamonds.&amp;nbsp;His experience as an engineer allows him to construct concepts as physical creations. Constant research, development and experimentation with methods and materials, coupled with his ability to blend thematic elements, results in work that is simultaneously stylistically distinct and ever-evolving.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A common motif in his work is the hummingbird. Dan explains: \&quot;I use these a lot in my work and see them as one of the most delicate and beautiful things in nature. Nature has never taken from us, yet we have exploited nature&#039;s generosity. For me, this hummingbird symbolises how fragile the natural world is; yet with some hard work, we can fix things.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Featuring the Ace of Hearts, Ace of Spades, Ace of Clubs and Ace of Diamonds, the limited edition glass gicl&amp;eacute;e prints and original 3D wall sculptures from Dan&#039;s &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Ace High by Dan Lane\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/dan-lane-ace-high-coalesce\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace High&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection explore his interest in playing card tricks and their historic symbolism.&amp;nbsp;Themes of war, love, wealth and power are intertwined with elements of nature for a modern style statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dan says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;My work acts as an invite into my intricate imagination; my dark yet beautiful world of nature against an industrial backdrop. I love the idea of having something beautiful like a butterfly or hummingbird try to find its place and break out of the mechanical worlds I create.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Dan Lane collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Dan_Lane\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Shop Dan&#039;s latest artworks here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:6526,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:6532,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Dan Lane &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the work of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Michelangelo and Antonio Canova, Dan&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Modern Relics by Dan Lane\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/modern%20relics\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modern Relics&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;series reimagines a classic style in a thoroughly modern setting. With authenticity in mind, he intertwines the exploration of how we treat our bodies with a desire to create works which look like they could be hundreds of years old. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dan says: \&quot;I have developed a technique of casting marble that gives it the right feel while also retaining the natural cracks and imperfections that are impossible to reproduce by painting. This alludes to my concept of these sculptures as a modern relic, as it gives the pieces a sense of age. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;The copper finish is one I&amp;rsquo;ve also developed over time. It&amp;rsquo;s a technique which mixes real, hand-applied copper leaf with paint-aging methods. The aging method can be taken to the extreme by using chemicals to produce a natural Verdigris (a bluish-green patina). I love the warm tones of the copper, and it really helps the engraved or sculpted tattoos stand out from the sculpture.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For authentic inspiration, Dan also visits classical sculptures and buildings around the world.

Dan says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The build-up of layers struck me. Some graffiti artists will do a whole mural, but then you also notice everyone&amp;rsquo;s put their little tag on there or something, and you get that accumulation of slightly different styles.&amp;nbsp;The end result is walls that look cool because they&amp;rsquo;re so random.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Breaking new ground for Hollywood &amp;ndash; including the first animated film with a synchronised soundtrack &amp;ndash; Walt Disney created a whole new world of magic.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;From original drawings to animation cels, hand-painted original backgrounds, model sheets and storyboards, our exclusive collection features the very best of Disney art. In a digital age, it is a rare insight into the behind-the-scenes workings of classic films like &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;\/em&gt; (1937), which was the world&amp;rsquo;s first full-length cel animated feature film and won an honorary Academy Award. Further titles include &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;\/em&gt; (1950) and &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;\/em&gt; (1967), which also included the genius of Walt Disney&amp;rsquo;s personal involvement. Additionally, the collection includes hand-drawn imagery from more contemporary productions like &lt;em&gt;The Nightmare Before Christmas&lt;\/em&gt; (1993), &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc.&lt;\/em&gt; (2002) and &lt;em&gt;Cars &lt;\/em&gt;(2006).&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Created by the artists who brought characters including Mickey Mouse, Peter Pan and Pinocchio to life, many feature hand-written production notes, timing charts, production numbers and visible drawing alterations. Other highlights include gold seal Art Corner setups originally sold at Disneyland, as well as original works from Courvoisier Gallery (1938-46), which was Disney&amp;rsquo;s first fine art endeavour.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Making the pieces rarer still is the exceptional quality of the selection. Only the most desirable illustrations are chosen; all of the characters have wonderful expressions and are often presented in iconic and immediately recognisable scenes with other characters. The collection is curated by world-renowned art dealer Ari Goldman, who has sold art to the Disney Animation Research Library and advised Christie&amp;rsquo;s and Sotheby&amp;rsquo;s. He adds: &amp;ldquo;These original works are part of the very DNA responsible for the magic of Disney&amp;rsquo;s global appeal. To me, it is amongst the most inexpensive and under-priced fine art available.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information on the different types of art, head over to our &lt;a title=\&quot;From the Studio | Disney Vintage \&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/artists\/disney-vintage#from-the-studio\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;text-decoration: underline;\&quot;&gt;From the Studio&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; page. &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Disney&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;It may seem hard to believe now, but when Disney first began making feature-length films in 1937, each movement had to be captured by an individual animation drawing and corresponding cel. When you consider that each frame represents 1\/24th of a second on screen, this was no mean feat.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While recent live-action films like &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;\/em&gt; are produced digitally, when Disney created its iconic movies, hundreds of animators worked together in one building to create the illusion of life through hand-painted cels. Here, we take you through some of their tools.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animation cel &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Short for &amp;lsquo;celluloid&amp;rsquo;, a cel is a transparent sheet which is painted or drawn onto. Laid over a static background, cels feature a black outline on the front and colours on the back to ensure colour separation and definition. Advancements in computer-generated imagery (CGI) have rendered cels archaic, with Disney abandoning the method in 1990.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model sheet&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Used to ensure continuity between the many artists who collaborated on an individual film, model sheets &amp;ndash; also known as character boards &amp;ndash; standardise the appearance and poses of characters. As &amp;lsquo;blueprints&amp;rsquo;, they depict the character&amp;rsquo;s head and body at different angles, basic facial expressions and detailed guidelines for their hands and feet.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storyboard&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A storyboard is a series of sketches which helps filmmakers to visualise a plot sequence by mapping out the story. Identifying inconsistencies or chances for further development, the method is a useful tool for previewing a film before the cameras start rolling. The concept is credited to the animator Webb Smith, who developed the idea at the Walt Disney Studio in the early 1930s. Storyboarding is still used in production today for both animated and live-action feature films.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animation drawing &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Animation drawings are accomplished in pencil on paper and are the first step in the final creation of characters. Each drawing will be traced onto the animation cel to form the black outline before it is filled with colour and photographed. Photographs of the cels are then run through the movie cameras, creating the illusion of life.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courvoisier setup&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Courvoisier setups were created between 1938 and 1946 in San Francisco and featured production backgrounds to complement the original animation cels. These included detailed watercolour backgrounds created by the Disney background department and the use of new airbrushing techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=stDEYZ3wG30&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:&quot;I hope we never lose sight of one thing \u2013 that it was all started by a mouse.&quot;,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:&quot;Walt Disney&quot;,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:16675,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:16676,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;VIN&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:16667,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:0},{&quot;id&quot;:257,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;domingo-zapata&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2020-01-20 10:16:42&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2021-11-18 12:28:51&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Domingo Zapata&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Described by &lt;em&gt;The New York Post&lt;\/em&gt; as &amp;lsquo;the next Andy Warhol&amp;rsquo;, Spanish-American artist Domingo Zapata paints Neo-Expressionist works which explore themes of opulence, sexuality and vitality.

Surrounded by &amp;ldquo;paint and fumes&amp;rdquo;, he explored his heritage and learnt about artists like Diego Vel&amp;aacute;zquez, Francisco Goya, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal&amp;iacute;. His art studies in London and subsequent political science degree took him to Wall Street, New York, in 1999, before he embarked on a career in the music industry and wrote lyrics for Michael Jackson. He was hugely influenced by pop culture and the aesthetics of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Created in oil and acrylic, Domingo&amp;rsquo;s works incorporate mixed media, collage and graffiti. His poetic imagination is visualised through layers of text and visual cues including symbols and iconic brands and figures. He says his work is a &amp;ldquo;conversation of colours&amp;rdquo;, with its distinctive style identified by the raw strokes of paint. Each piece is designed to have a positive influence on the viewer.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bold colours, dripping lines and swooping hearts echo Domingo&amp;rsquo;s belief in the concept of &lt;em&gt;el duende&lt;\/em&gt;: a heightened physical and emotional response to an artistic performance. Like the flamenco dance, his art expresses movement and passion, but the tranquility of the central panda creates a sense of calm, a yin to the yang of the surrounding chaos. Graffiti motifs such as hearts, skulls and crowns reflect his urban inspirations.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Domingo&amp;rsquo;s art is collected by celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and features in the collections of the Missoni family and the investment bank Goldman Sachs.&amp;nbsp;His projects are as varied as his paintings: alongside joining forces with the Pope and the French street artist Mr. Brainwash, he has exhibited at New York Fashion Week and the Venice Biennale. Public installations include a five-foot stainless steel shark sculpture in the lobby of the United Nations headquarters to raise awareness of ocean pollution, and a record-breaking mural in Times Square. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Domingo says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;No matter the subject, you&amp;rsquo;ll always be able to recognise my style. The strokes, mix of different colours and messages are unique, and that is my signature.&amp;nbsp;My paintings carry a message of positivity and happiness.&amp;nbsp;I just want to make the world a more beautiful place.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Find out more about Pandamonium by Domingo Zapata\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/talk-to-an-art-consultant\&quot;&gt;To find out more about Domingo&#039;s new &lt;em&gt;Pandamonium&lt;\/em&gt; collection, contact us&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:125,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Domingo Zapata &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Domingo has studios in New York City, Miami and Hollywood, but paints all over the world, believing each region gives his art a different energy. He usually works at night, spending up to 14 hours at a time creating his Neo-Expressionist paintings. Often, he sketches his ideas in a notebook and then reworks on a larger canvas. He says: \&quot;I don&#039;t recall a single day in my life without painting.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His art is also not limited to paper or canvas. In August 2019, Domingo embarked on his most ambitious project to date: a retrospective of his work across a 15-story vinyl canvas at One Times Square. The 30,000 sq ft mural took pride of place in one of New York City&amp;rsquo;s busiest spots, where an estimated 350,000 people walk by each day. For six days, Domingo painted from suspended state-of-the-art scaffolding, capturing themes and highlights from his 20-year career, including his mantra, &amp;lsquo;life is a dream&amp;rsquo;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In January 2020, Domingo once again collaborated with Pope Francis to celebrate the head of the Catholic Church&amp;rsquo;s 50th year since ordination. The sovereign of the Vatican City State added his signature cross and a bird to Domingo&amp;rsquo;s red heart. The canvas will be auctioned in New York City to benefit the Pope&#039;s arts education charity, the Pontifical Scholas Occurrentes Foundation, through which the pair have raised over $1.5 million.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of his paintings, Domingo designs clothes (including for New York Fashion Week), has written a novel and took part in a &#039;live art performance&#039; in front of 40,000 people at the Concert for Peace in Madrid. Recent projects include his 2021 collaboration with Grand Hyatt Tokyo, which has transformed a section of its lobby into an art space to bring vibrancy back into the local community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

She went on to hold a solo exhibition of 38 portraits at the Watts Gallery and appear as a contestant on Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year, where she painted the film star Richard E. Grant. Her work is also owned by the British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Spiralling across each of the large-scale paintings from her &lt;a title=\&quot;Afterglow | Emma-Leone Palmer\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/afterglow\/artists\/Emma-Leone_Palmer\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Afterglow &lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;collection is a seemingly chaotic entanglement of neon wires. Allegorising not only the complexity of our thoughts but the digital information we receive and process on a daily basis, these bursts of light illuminate the female subjects whilst deepening the darkness they inhabit. The scale is deliberately larger than life to impose and make us confront the feelings of the women.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Exuding vibrancy and sensuality, her latest release,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;&amp;Eacute;KSTASIS | Emma-Leone Palmer\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/ekstasis\/artists\/Emma-Leone_Palmer\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;Eacute;KSTASIS&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;,&lt;\/em&gt; is a celebration of losing ourselves in the moment and embracing the magic of being alive. Through her fearless paintings, Emma-Leone Palmer explores the synergy of art, music and light; with rhythm pulsing through her veins, she has pushed the possibilities of oil paint to combine the canonical painting modes of the Renaissance with the hyper-neon colours of the 21st century.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Creating contrast between darkness and luminescence through &lt;em&gt;chiaroscuro &lt;\/em&gt;&amp;ndash; a technique used by artists including Caravaggio &amp;ndash; Emma uses light as an allegory for energy. She explains: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to make my own energy. I am alive, and I want to paint paintings that make me feel alive. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be colourful, bold and totally me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Emma adds: \&quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a mid-tone person: I love the highlights, the juicy little pop bits, and the darkness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;Eacute;KSTASIS&lt;\/em&gt; is about uplifting energy, and how we are projecting it forwards, upwards and outwards.&amp;nbsp;This is what happens when you stop editing yourself and just exist.

Using colours similar to infrared photography, the Surrey-based artist captures the futuristic otherness of the body by exploring each subject&amp;rsquo;s intimate connection with energy.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;She is moved by a compulsive urge to create and the challenge of capturing an emotion. For Emma, painting is as innate as breathing. She loves the feeling of oil paint between her fingers and the way the colours move and blend.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Emma says: &amp;ldquo;I paint what I connect with, or what has me questioning...an allure, the way the light dances and caresses certain areas. I paint faces, although I like to say I paint expressions&amp;hellip;not just what is on the aesthetic surface, but what is underneath. It&amp;rsquo;s the internal dialogue versus the external portrayal. The painting is only done when it starts talking back to me, like it has become more than me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While painting, she listens to anything from electronic dance to pop, funk and rock. She adds: &amp;ldquo;The music comes on, and the paint starts flowing. I listen to music every day to get me into my zone, my &amp;lsquo;flow state&amp;rsquo;. Music always takes you to places; like art or literature, it transports you to another world, somewhere above yourself.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re so focused and connected, time and your sense of self disappear. You feel completely and utterly in tune with you&amp;rsquo;re doing &amp;ndash; whether that&amp;rsquo;s painting, running, writing, or making love. In life, we are all searching for that &amp;lsquo;thing&amp;rsquo;: the portal to our freedom.

Capa invited her to join the group, and she became its first American female member. She was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Magazine Photographers in 1980. Then in 1995, she was made a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and was elected &#039;Master Photographer&#039; - the world&#039;s most prestigious photographic honour - by New York&#039;s International Centre of Photography.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Eve had a special affinity with movie star Marilyn Monroe, who she met when they were both still relatively unknown.&lt;em&gt;\&quot;&lt;\/em&gt;She was going places, but she hadn&#039;t arrived,\&quot; Eve recalled. \&quot;It became a bond between us... Marilyn was very important in my career. I think I was helpful in hers.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;She also captured the lives of ordinary people, exploring themes including birth, family, tragedy and racial prejudice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Eve passed away on January 4th 2012, aged 99. She will forever be remembered, both for her truly brilliant photographs and as an inspiration to female photojournalists the world over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:null,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10791,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10790,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;EAR&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6380,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:64,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;frederic-daty&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:46&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2021-05-04 15:46:41&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Daty&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;A conjurer of light and shadow, French sculptor Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric explores the world that exists between nature and technology.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;banner_id&quot;:6572,&quot;meta_title&quot;:&quot;About Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Daty&quot;,&quot;meta_description&quot;:&quot;International artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Daty is known for his striking sculptures.

Keen to explore his artistic vision, he abandoned the Parisian lifestyle and flew to North America before settling in his current homeplace of Chartres, France.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His passion for honesty is reflected in his choice of medium. He works with steel due to its raw, primal quality. Light and shadows play an essential role in his art, as the light animates the metal and plays with it, changing the colour and giving the impression of constant evolvement and life.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;There are always three elements to my work: the metal symbolising Mother Earth, the stylised figurative shapes representing the spiritual realm, and the light and shadows that evoke movement and change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Daty &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric fought the boredom of reality with dreams and the creation of his own world. From heroic fantasy to science fiction, his inspirations pushed him to explore. He was particularly moved by artists such as Victor Vasarely, Giacomo Balla and M.C. Escher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, he has taken inspiration from photographic surrealism, chiaroscuro, kinetic art and Chinese ink art. While his stylised shapes are primarily designed to be pleasing to the eye, their purpose is to make the viewer contemplate the subtleties of their own life and reflect on their memories.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: \&quot;The light and shadow also play an essential role. The light animates the metal and plays with it depending on the time of day and movements of people in the room. Although the metal itself is static, its changing surface and colour give the impression that it is moving and evolving.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;There are always three elements to my work: metal (symbolising Mother Earth and the basic elements); the stylised figurative shapes (which represent the spiritual realm), and light and shadows (which evoke movement and change). This trinity, in turn, represents life and what I believe in.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/youtu.be\/ubTm6uQsVdE&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10794,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10795,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;FDA&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6571,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:259,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;hanna-barbera&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2020-11-28 09:38:01&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2023-01-19 16:41:45&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hanna-Barbera&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Featuring rare archive animation art from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera&amp;rsquo;s studio, our &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Hanna-Barbera collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/hanna-barbera-classic-cartoon-art-2021\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hanna-Barbera&lt;\/em&gt; collection&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; captures the magic of classic Saturday morning cartoons.

It was a far cry from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera&amp;rsquo;s early days, when they would draw storyboards at home! Amongst the staff were former MGM animators and layout artists including Lewis Marshall and Ed Benedict, along with voice actors such as Don Messick (who voiced Scooby-Doo, Muttley, Boo-Boo Bear and Papa Smurf amongst others). In the late 1960s, as the studio created more human characters, comic book artists like Alex Toth and Warren Tufts also joined the ranks.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Animators used a planned animation process, whereby frames were repeated to lower the number needed and speed up production. Because of this, the studio could focus more on scriptwriting, situational comedy and creative camerawork. It also led to many characters being drawn with collars and neckties so the heads could be seamlessly separated onto a separate cel. As a result, Huckleberry Hound&#039;s red bowtie, Scooby-Doo&#039;s dog collar and Yogi Bear&#039;s signature green tie are not just fashion accessories but a shrewd animation technique!&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The shows and characters responded to real-life events, including Cold War espionage and the popularity of James Bond in the 1960s, which led to the creation of the Secret Squirrel character. Despite television networks not broadcasting in colour until 1965, Hanna and Barbera also had the foresight to create their cartoons in colour. Along with their programmes, the studio branched out into opening credits (including &lt;em&gt;Bewitched &lt;\/em&gt;in 1964) and crossovers with comic books, most notably with their Scooby-Doo franchise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Today, audiences around the world can instantly recognise the studio&#039;s many catchphrases, including &#039;Zoinks!&#039;, &#039;Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAANN&#039; and &#039;Yabba-dabba-doo!&#039;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/youtu.be\/mc8N4eOjEE0&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:28625,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:28626,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;HBR&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:37004,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:0},{&quot;id&quot;:258,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;illuminati-neon&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2020-09-29 08:28:54&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-11-24 15:05:03&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Illuminati Neon&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Collected by celebrities including Sir Elton John, Sting and Boy George, Mark Sloper - known as Illuminati Neon - moves in the same circles as some of showbiz&amp;rsquo;s best-known names.

Spearheaded by bands like The Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sex Pistols and The Damned, this ear-splitting fusion of anarchy and expression defined a generation. Its working-class angst spoke to a young Mark, and after a chance encounter with the new wave musician Adam Ant at the age of just 11 led to him touring with the band, Mark became drawn to the punk subculture, eventually becoming close friends with some of the movement&#039;s pioneers and troubadours, including the Sex Pistols and the Stranglers.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A career in videography beckoned, and Mark went on to work as a cameraman and a director of photography for bands like the Police and Frankie Goes to Hollywood before joining the BBC.&amp;nbsp;During his successful film career, Mark has directed and produced documentaries on Billy Fury, the Beatles, John Lennon, David Bowie, Sid Vicious, the Sex Pistols and more. These legendary figures, along with his friend and fellow neon artist Chris Bracey, inspired Mark to create the Illuminati Neon brand.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Featuring punk-inspired imagery emblazoned with neon, vintage memorabilia and song lyrics, his original artworks have commanded the attention of the art world. In 2019, he was showcased at the prestigious Saatchi Gallery for their START Art Fair, which features some of the best emerging global talent.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Mark was featured by the press when his punk portrait of Queen Elizabeth II received the royal approval from none other than the Queen herself! The matriarch is said to have enjoyed the artwork, but requested that her &amp;lsquo;Philip&amp;rsquo; heart tattoo be changed to the royal crest - and Mark dutifully obliged. He says: &amp;ldquo;Allegedly, she burst out laughing but requested that it be changed so that it matched her bathrobes and slippers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hand-painted in oils and acrylics at his studio in Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Bush, London, his fluorescent creations are just as anarchic as their namesake. The handblown glass neon is formed using a centuries-old technique, echoing the exhilarating mixture of modern and classical that shaped the punk rock aesthetic.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mark says: &amp;ldquo;Every piece tells a story about that transformative era: my experience of it, the people who made it and became my friends, and the honorary punks who personified its anarchy, chaos and rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll long before the movement had a name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop Mark&#039;s new collection, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Chaos&lt;\/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Illuminati Neon collection online\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/the-art-of-chaos-illuminati-neon\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Illuminati Neon &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;All of Mark&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Illuminati Neon&#039;s original artworks\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Illuminati_Neon\/types\/Original\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original artworks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; are hand-painted using acrylics or oils and he uses jewels and gold leaf as finishing elements to create complexity and make each piece unique. His handblown glass neon is formed using a centuries-old technique. This involves delicately bending the glass under a temperature of 500\u02daC and compressing gas within the tubes before using electric transformers to ignite it and create an organic glow. The true colour of neon is red, so Mark uses powder-coated neon tubes filled with argon (a chemical element) to produce a spectrum of colours. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mark&amp;rsquo;s influences include the iconic neon artist Chris Bracey. He says: &amp;ldquo;I met him at God&amp;rsquo;s Own Junkyard (a huge emporium of vintage neon signs in London), and we swapped pictures. The art comes before the neon: I use the neon to express a statement and enhance the artwork beneath.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For his original queen-themed pieces, Mark enjoys making the works look like paintings by the Old Masters by framing them ornately; they are then &amp;ldquo;punkified&amp;rdquo; by glowing neon. The queen&amp;rsquo;s head is foam mounted to give a 3D effect, and the background of newspaper headlines is washed in deep blue dripping oils. The crowns can have up to 2800 jewels! &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mark sources his flags from an antique dealer on Portobello Road in London, selecting those with genuine provenance and historical value. These include memorabilia from World War Two, along with flags from the UK Royal Palaces at the turn of the century. He&amp;nbsp;explains: &amp;ldquo;I upscale the flags by mounting them to a modern board and sewing holes where necessary. Then I preserve them with fabric conditioners and glazes before mounting neon statements upon them. The ornate frames give a timeless feel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We visited Mark at his art space in Shepherd&#039;s Bush, London - home to one of the capital&#039;s most sought-after music scenes. He told us: \&quot;Whilst in my studio, you might bump into a real-life, foul-mouthed Sex Pistol. Good folks say &amp;lsquo;Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s such a cultural hub you&amp;rsquo;ve created.&amp;rsquo; Bollocks: it&amp;rsquo;s organic chaos, pure and simple. This is my studio: I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by art, mess and an explosion of neon colour.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

At the forefront of the movement was James Francis Gill, a Texas-born architectural designer who would go on to count Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Indiana and Andy Warhol amongst his peers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;banner_id&quot;:14088,&quot;meta_title&quot;:null,&quot;meta_description&quot;:null,&quot;meta_keywords&quot;:null,&quot;opengraph_id&quot;:null,&quot;thumbnail_id&quot;:14085,&quot;born&quot;:&quot;Texas, USA&quot;,&quot;lives_and_works&quot;:&quot;San Angelo, Texas &quot;,&quot;education&quot;:&quot;University of Texas &quot;,&quot;awards&quot;:null,&quot;exhibitions&quot;:&quot;Alan Gallery, New York (1962), Felix Landau Gallery, Los Angeles (1963-67), S\u00e3o Paulo 9 Biennial (1967), San Angelo Museum of Fine Arts (2005)&quot;,&quot;quote&quot;:&quot;It\u2019s not the fame or money that makes you happy, it\u2019s being in tune with your life and what you\u2019re doing.&quot;,&quot;quote_image1_id&quot;:14089,&quot;quote_image2_id&quot;:14622,&quot;quote_image3_id&quot;:38351,&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mt6lodaucv8&quot;,&quot;video_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;From a stint in the United States Marine Corps to breakfast with John Wayne, James&amp;rsquo; life has been as colourful as his art. Celebrated for his montage effects, he captures the American Dream through intimate portraits of stars like Marilyn Monroe, Bob Dylan and Grace Kelly. His painterly style has been likened to Francis Bacon, while the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;\/em&gt; in 1962 prophesised that his art was &amp;lsquo;jazzy and up-to-date&amp;hellip;an artist to watch&amp;rsquo;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Moving to Los Angeles in 1962, he grabbed the attention of the art dealer Felix Landau, who had already introduced artists like Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Francis Bacon and David Hockney to the US art market. He went on to be commissioned to paint the covers of famous titles like &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;\/em&gt; magazine, and capture public figures like John Wayne and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Following a long list of celebrity collectors and an international breakthrough at the S&amp;atilde;o Paulo 9 Biennial (1967), James went into self-imposed exile in 1972 to develop his artistic expression away from the constraints of the material world. During this time, his &amp;lsquo;Marilyn Triptych&amp;rsquo; stayed in the permanent collection of New York&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Modern Art, where it resides to this day.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his return, James says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;For me it is absolutely exciting to return to Great Britain after so many years. I am happy that my works are shown here, because here art has always played an important role in people&#039;s lives - just like in mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of James Francis Gill &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;James&#039; separations of light and shadow are inspired by magazines. As a child, he was gifted a July 1914 issue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;by a colleague of his father. The edition featured the publication&amp;rsquo;s first-ever natural colour photographs and sparked a lifelong passion for imagery. Working with montage effects &amp;ndash; which he terms metamage &amp;ndash; James has experimented with techniques including stone lithography, intaglio printmaking, woodcuts and etching.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Painterly in style, James&amp;rsquo; art transcends the parameters of Pop Art. Described by the late art scholar William Seitz as an &amp;lsquo;incisive and startling commentator&amp;rsquo; whose art is &amp;lsquo;timeless and universal&amp;rsquo;, he merges iconography with startling colour. He believes that every painting is an experience, and even jokes that sleep is something he has to endure to start a new artwork each morning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In her 1966 book, &lt;em&gt;Pop Art&lt;\/em&gt;, Lucy Lippard notes that: &amp;lsquo;Often he mimics the effects of excerpted frames from a film strip, or fixes a transient television image&amp;rsquo;, while the photographer Van Deren Coke remarked that the cut-off format of many of James&amp;rsquo; artworks owes its origin to camera-vision.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:15433,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:15434,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;JGI&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:14086,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;james-mcqueen&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2022-01-17 16:47:06&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-10-06 11:03:42&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;James McQueen&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;You should never judge a book by its cover, and James McQueen is keeping his firmly under wraps.

Taking an object you can hold in your hands and blowing it up into something you can hang on your wall has been a long-time fascination of the artist, who seeks to capture the look and feel of vintage books via layers of stripped-back paint. An avid collector, he can often be found amongst the dusty shelves and secret backrooms of old bookshops in New York and London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Using paint and a spray can, James light-heartedly subverts the traditional representation of Penguin Books covers through his tongue-in-cheek titles and bold, contemporary aesthetic.&amp;nbsp;The subject of books &amp;ndash; explored by artists including the American illustrator Norman Rockwell&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; is given a modern feel through the incorporation of graffiti elements. Inspired by street artists like Banksy, these urban touches elevate the vintage, distressed feel of the book covers, adding texture and challenging their history. James adds: \&quot;I want to create that wear and tear, that authenticity.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to do something clean. It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to do something with straight lines. It&amp;rsquo;s much harder to make something look old and tired.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Uniting book-lovers, ardent readers and collectors of art, his debut release, &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Non-Fiction by James McQueen\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/non-fiction-by-james-mcqueen\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-Fiction&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;, evokes the deeply personal experience and nostalgia that a book can create for its owner.&amp;nbsp;Our emotional response to the words of a book &amp;ndash; whether on the inside pages or the front cover&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; is personal to us. Just as each person interprets a character, or an artwork, differently, the quotes from James&#039; book covers hold significance in uniquely special ways. The carefully-selected typography gives these titles a voice, allowing them to convey a message through humour or caution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;James is a collector not only of books, but of memories; as a child, he painted with his grandfather and watched&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Joy of Painting&lt;\/em&gt;, an American live-painting show starring Bob Ross. Stylistic influences have also been meticulously shelved: the boldness of Tracey Emin, the honesty of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the abstraction of Francis Bacon. Likened to those of Mark Rothko, his faded layers reveal a surprising complexity to his work, heightened by a background in photography and woodwork. Joined together like the letters of a word, all of these elements combine to create art for people who want to escape from the stress and seriousness of real life, as if into the pages of a good book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Non-Fiction collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/non-fiction-by-james-mcqueen\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop James&#039; &lt;em&gt;Non-Fiction&lt;\/em&gt; collection here.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of James McQueen&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ahead of the launch of his new &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Non-Fiction by James McQueen\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/non-fiction-by-james-mcqueen\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-Fiction&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection, we visited James at his London studio to get the low-down on his book-themed artworks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;James is fascinated by the faded effect of vintage books, which he achieves by sanding down the layers of paint on the canvas&amp;nbsp;to create an amazing mixture of hues, before finishing with a layer of lacquer.&amp;nbsp;He explains:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in the way that books age; if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a stack of books on a shelf, the daylight will create incredible effects, making each cover fade into a spectrum of different colours.&amp;nbsp;I want to create that old, that wear and tear, that authenticity. The exposure of these layers represents the history and journey of the artwork, just as a used book will have its own story.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A creative background in photography and woodwork has formed the perfect combination of skills needed to create his almost photorealist book covers. Like the American abstract painter Mark Rothko, James produces an endless succession of rich variants on the canvas with regions of pure colour, which he further abstracts. Rothko, famous for his layered transparencies of vibrant pigments and earth tones, created luminous and ethereal soft-edged compositions through colour - a technique that James has modified for his own work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;James explores typography when selecting his quotes, ensuring that each font matches the tone of voice. The quotes he chooses are both humorous and cautionary, occasionally controversial, but always eye-catching. He adds:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to step on anyone&amp;rsquo;s toes. I want to have fun and play with the quotes, maybe take it a little too high or close to the edge, but it&amp;rsquo;s all about balance.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like when you want to go out and dress up in a certain way. Sometimes you might wonder, &#039;Am I brave enough to wear this?&#039;.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

His materials were unorthodox, including household emulsion mixed with K-Y Jelly, yet the quality of his work led Christie&amp;rsquo;s to value one of his paintings at &amp;pound;25,000. This was the moment that the business stopped and the crime began.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Between 1986 and 1994, John faked as many as 200 works by artists like Marc Chagall and Alberto Giacometti, fooling collectors and experts at Christie&#039;s, Sotheby&#039;s and the Tate Modern alike. Many of these counterfeit works found their way into private collections and public institutions in the United Kingdom and abroad. Eventually the scheme was exposed by Scotland Yard, and Myatt was sentenced to a year in HM Prison Brixton for his role in this now-legendary art fraud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Upon his release from prison, John was persuaded to pick up his brush again by the detective who arrested him. In recent years, he has emulated the style of legendary artists like Henri Matisse, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Klee, Leonardo da Vinci and Vincent van Gogh. Comparing himself to an actor immersing himself in a role, he says he climbs into the mind of his chosen artist to adopt, rather than copy, their technique. In a 2005 interview with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;newspaper, John explained:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I try to get the artist&amp;rsquo;s work to hypnotise me. I also surround myself with lots of books. I like to know everything&amp;hellip;where he was, what he was doing&amp;hellip;when he was painting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside television appearances on shows such as &lt;em&gt;A Brush with Fame&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fame in the Frame&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fake! The Great Masterpiece Challenge&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fake or Fortune&lt;\/em&gt;, John has worked with Oxford University, Cambridge University and the San Diego Museum of Art, and now advises the police on art fraud.

He paints every day, spending around 30-35 hours per week in his studio. He has even been known to be hard at it at 3am in the morning! Experimentation is key to recreating the spectrum of effects favoured by different artists: John uses everything from paintbrushes to sponge rollers, spray guns and K-Y Jelly, with the latter creating a smooth finish for his paintings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;John says: &amp;ldquo;Using another artist&amp;rsquo;s work is a great opportunity to not just look passively at their art but engage with it and see how they&amp;rsquo;ve achieved their effects and techniques. I was successful because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t creating copies; it was new work in the style of a particular artist &amp;ndash; which is much more fun. This way, you can put a bit of yourself into the process. For example, Monet would never use fluorescent colours, but using modern paints gives the work more bite. The original painting is a template and you end up putting it to one side to create new work.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;lsquo;age&amp;rsquo; old paintings, John uses strong coffee or brown umber, which is a natural earth pigment. To give the impression of &lt;em&gt;craquelure&lt;\/em&gt; - a fine web of cracks in old paint - John has a specific way of layering varnishes to produce an ultra-quick cracking pattern. While any scientist analysing these paintings would spot that they&amp;rsquo;re made with modern materials, the point of a good fake is that it&amp;rsquo;s so convincing that no one will think to analyse it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;John adds: &amp;ldquo;I love the challenge of looking at a new artist, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed every single one I&amp;rsquo;ve emulated &amp;ndash; from 1960s Modernism to 19th century Impressionism, I like it all. The Pre-Raphaelites created perhaps the most technically challenging pieces, with some taking up to 18 months to complete. It&amp;rsquo;s phenomenal, but a little bit too much like hard work!\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

He is an innate student of human behaviour; studying, translating, and harnessing qualities he sees in others to weave into the tapestry of the persona he is creating. This has resulted in laser sharp powers of observation, and the ability to identify and utilise the subtlest nuance.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He has wielded this skill in his visual art, using it to create a true authenticity and depth in the portraits of those who have become the most important figures in his life, those who have altered the course of his life, providing influence and inspiration.&amp;nbsp; A closer look at his portraiture reveals the qualities that Depp felt his subjects revealed most keenly to him, or are his strongest points of recall when revisiting times shared and memories made&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With his sketchbook as a permanent fixture in his hand, rarely is there a time when Depp isn&amp;rsquo;t sketching or visually conceptualising the world around him.

I still get butterflies going to see an exhibition of his work &amp;ndash; he makes me want to paint!&amp;nbsp;I like artists who use thick impasto paint, like Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach. In my mind, this is how oil painting should be: seeing the brushstrokes and understanding how a painting is constructed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Kings Heath, Birmingham, he was drawn to the darker side of history and shunned playing football with this friends in favour of exploring the local Hare and Hounds pub, where the landlord regaled tales of hangings and said the cellar was used as a mortuary. As an adult, he went on to hold exhibitions based on prostitution in 18th century London and the history and meanings behind nursery rhymes.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He has worked extensively with the West Midlands Police Museum to explore the criminal underworld of 19th century Birmingham.

He once worked at a special needs school, and the music helps to add some chatter to the relatively solitary environment of an artist&amp;rsquo;s studio.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jon uses brushwork to explore the relationship between light and shadow, using a technique called chiaroscuro. This method, which involves creating tonal contrasts, was used by artists including Leonardo da Vinci. He also uses the Impressionist technique of marking, whereby separate brush marks and dabs of paint add light, life and movement to paintings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jon says: \&quot;When I start a new painting, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve been painting for years, I still have a real fear and anxiety. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than looking at a blank wall. But as soon as a scribble is on the board, it&amp;rsquo;s broken up and I can relax again. I treat a painting like a jigsaw puzzle: you just try and work out where everything is, and hopefully everything then starts to make sense. Towards the end, it all fits together.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To add emotion to his portraits, Jon focuses on the eyes. He explains:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;My mother used to say that she disliked Lucian Freud because the eyes are dead and expressionless; whenever I choose a portrait to paint, I want to make it feel alive. You read a face by its emotion.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Over the last three decades, he has traversed and reflected upon the elements to develop his own distinctive style, which combines traditional landscape painting with modern techniques. In 2019, he celebrated his 20-year anniversary with our publisher, Washington Green Fine Art.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lawrence&#039;s paintings fuse the serenity and drama of landscape art. His majestic backdrops inspire a meditative mood, allowing the viewer to escape into the idealised scenery. Whether he uses a fiery or melancholic palette, his art combines the reality of everyday life and the escapist virtues of fantasy and nature.&amp;nbsp;His everlasting love for the British landscape is weaved into every painting, with influences including artists like J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich and Edward Seago.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Capturing natural light through finger-blended oil paints and fine brush work, his paintings are renowned for their ability to evoke powerful emotions. Some viewers have described his work as &#039;Turneresque&#039;, or described a spiritual experience. During his live-painting appearances at galleries nationwide, our collectors have been given an exclusive insight into his techniques and inspirations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The panoramic East Anglian landscape &amp;ndash; especially the wide-open fenland and broad beaches of Norfolk &amp;ndash; is a treasure trove of awe-inspiring scenes to spark his imagination. Lawrence adds: \&quot;The beauty of a landscape painter is that one never ceases to learn. My heart still beats for the incomparable landscapes of Britain and belongs to our fair and pleasant land.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His spring 2022 release, titled &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Journeys by Lawrence Coulson\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Lawrence_Coulson\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journeys&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;, explores the beauty of the Scottish Highlands. Depicting a moonlit sky and a blazing sunset over the northern coastline, these stunning scenes draw upon time spent in the wild and spiritual setting of the Cairngorms mountain range.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lawrence says: \&quot;I see beauty in the simplest of things. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in playing with narratives and characters, and using light and texture in different ways to evoke emotions. My head is full of ideas I&amp;rsquo;d love to explore.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the latest art from Lawrence Coulson\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Lawrence_Coulson\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop Lawrence&#039;s latest artworks here&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:154,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Lawrence Coulson &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence feels a spiritual connection to his surroundings, from the sights to the sounds and smells. He begins with a simple pencil line to denote the horizon before mentally mapping out the rest of the composition. Following this, he applies oil paint before blending it with his fingers and then again with a fine brush. He repeats this process until his painting does justice to the landscape in his mind.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: \&quot;The very start is probably the most exciting bit, the moment when you put that blank panel or blank canvas on the easel. I get a buzz when I go to an art supply shop and see the blank panels standing there; to me it&amp;rsquo;s not intimidating at all. There&amp;rsquo;s a real sense of anticipation, even with a clear idea of what I&amp;rsquo;d like to lay down in paint. The best part is starting and seeing how a painting will develop.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Lawrence has become more experimental with his technique. He uses cocktail sticks to meticulously scratch in detail and individual blades of grass, while palette knives add texture. Oil based materials give his works a lustre, depth, warmth and tone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He says:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;I still take immense enjoyment from gathering my own reference shots, and I have been known to hare off with my camera at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice if I spot a particularly striking sunset from my studio window.&amp;nbsp;The landscape here in rural South Lincolnshire is a mixture of farmland, pasture and dense woodland. I can walk out into huge vistas with towering skies, or absorb myself in silent trees and foliage.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

He studied at the American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York before enjoying a brief career as an actor.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After turning his hand to sculpture, he gained notable commissions, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Tree of Life&lt;\/em&gt;, which was created for the United Nations and issued as a stamp in 1993. In 1994, he created a likeness of Saint Anthony for the Basilica del Santo in Padua, which was blessed by the Pope in front of a 35,000-strong crowd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Recent projects include the inauguration of his &amp;lsquo;Give&amp;rsquo; sculpture at the Uffizi Gardens in Florence in August 2020. This was a gift from the artist and our sister gallery, Halcyon Gallery, to the Italian city of Pietrasanta, where it is now displayed at the International Sculpture Park. The sculpture shows the hand of a man joining that of a woman to underline the value of giving. It evokes a message of peace and addresses humanity, which is symbolised by an olive tree.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lorenzo prides himself on sculpting the most technically challenging part of the human body. For him, hands symbolise the power we have as humans to impact both our lives and those of people around us. He explains:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The hand holds so much power: the power to love, create, hate and destroy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Lorenzo Quinn collection online\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Lorenzo_Quinn\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browse Lorenzo&#039;s collection online here&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Lorenzo Quinn &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a taste of what the sculptor has been up to recently!

It is here in the leafy suburbs of Hampshire that all of Nic&#039;s figures are carved as originals in wire and plaster before being cast in solid bronze using the lost-wax process. Also known as &lt;em&gt;cire perdue&lt;\/em&gt;, this is a method of metal casting whereby a molten metal is poured into a mould that has been created with a wax model. Once the mould is created, the wax model is melted and drained away.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When dry, they are sanded down (either with a belt sander or a teeny-tiny strip of sandpaper) and cleaned before being hand-painted. The scaffolding is brazed with a blowtorch to create texture and a natural colour definition before being cut out of the thin plywood. Once Nic has all of the necessary parts, he can begin the painstaking construction, which can include installing anything from LED lights to replica mobile phones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=\&quot;Find out more about Nic Joly&#039;s 65 Weeks collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/nic-joly-65-weeks\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;65 Weeks&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection, Nic experimented with Japanese inks and glitter to capture his tumultuous emotions and wry observations following Boris Johnson&#039;s announcement of a UK COVID-19 lockdown. Describing the series as his \&quot;most personal\&quot; collection yet, he adds: \&quot;When we all woke up on 23rd March 2020, none of us could really understand how our whole world was about to change forever.&amp;nbsp;I had time to think, to grow what I believed in, and to look at ideas I had never had the time to look at before.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop #365 by Nic Joly\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/customise-your-nic-joly-artwork-the-365-collection\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#365&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; release saw him fashion tiny disco balls from polysterene and plaster; each one was dipped and primed five times before it was covered in glitter and lacquered. Every egg was bleached before he pierced it with an electric drill, removing fragments with a pair of tweezers. The words &#039;We are all fragile&#039; were printed onto water transfer paper and applied to the egg before it was dried so Nic could paint over the words by hand, while the customisable mirrored acrylic letters were designed by Nic and are cut with a laser cutter before being hand-polished.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about the collection &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Nic Joly&#039;s 65 Weeks collection \&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/nic-joly-65-weeks\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.

He hopes to spread happiness through his work and admires artists such as the American painter Norman Rockwell, the comic book artist Alex Ross and the English illustrator Arthur Rackham.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After capturing superheroes and villains like Wonder Woman, Black Panther and the Joker, Nigel turned his focus to music stars for his &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Mixtape collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/mixtape\/artists\/Nigel_Humphries\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixtape&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection. Researching outfits, poses and unique features (including Freddie Mercury&#039;s chest hair!), he created a spectacular line-up that includes everything from pop to rock &#039;n&#039; roll. Nigel says: &amp;ldquo;Small figures are always fun, no matter what genre.

He explains:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;I remember when I watched the first film [&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;\/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Episode IV)&lt;\/em&gt; (1977)] for the first time, I was blown away by the storyline, the character design, the world-building and the special effects. I knew it was something unique, and it set the bar for all of the sci-fi films that came afterwards.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nigel&#039;s small-scale artworks are fantastic for budding art collectors or as a gift, particularly if you have any awkward wall spaces that need refreshing. He says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I like my smaller-sized artworks, as not everyone has the wall space for big pieces.

After cuddling his two rescue greyhounds, we were escorted to his purpose-built studio in the back garden, where he has a cabinet full of Funko Pop characters and a drum kit to rest his easel on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To capture the energy of his famous personas, Nigel watches videos and researches costumes and photography. He also listens to a &#039;top hits&#039; playlist of each artist for inspiration. Details such as creases, moustaches and facial expressions are captured using fine brushwork.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For each piece, he sets up a miniature theatre stage with crumpled paper for the backdrop and the star of the show lit up in the centre. The initial layout is outlined on the canvas in willow charcoal before oil paint is applied onto a fine-grain linen canvas panel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;\/em&gt; themed series has allowed him to experiment with a range of finishes and textures. He explains: \&quot;I enjoy painting the stormtroopers because with this new series, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the technique slightly and I&amp;rsquo;m painting with thicker coats of paint and a more &lt;em&gt;impasto&lt;\/em&gt; technique as it lends itself well to the armour. I like the stormtroopers to look like they&amp;rsquo;ve just come back from a skirmish, so they&amp;rsquo;re a bit battleworn.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Want to find out more?

My love for fashion is endless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a pair of Christian Louboutin heels or Converse trainers, Pascale believes that a person can make their own decision about how their clothing impacts their individual style and confidence; it is not up to society to decide this. She adds: &amp;ldquo;For me, being beautiful is not very important, but how people feel in the clothes they wear, that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Featured at the Paris Art Fair and Art Dubai, along with publications including&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pratique des Arts&lt;\/em&gt;, Pascale&#039;s artworks have taken many forms, from urban art on the streets of Paris to emotive figurative works displayed at&amp;nbsp;Le Salon d&amp;rsquo;Automne on the Avenue des Champs-Elys&amp;eacute;es. Her journey of self-discovery has taken her to the Middle East, and led her to experiment with materials such as gold leaf, which she says embodies \&quot;the strength, beauty and light of female nature.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Pascale says: \&quot;Most of our homes are so sober and need a touch of madness; my paintings show that we have this. They can help you to show what you like, or remind you of something. I want my work to be free for people to put their own imaginations to. They can imagine &#039;who is this woman&#039;, or &#039;who is this man?&#039; and imagine their own story, or put themselves into it.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Pascale Taurua&#039;s collection \&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Pascale_Taurua\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Shop Pascale&#039;s latest original and limited edition artworks here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Pascale Taurua&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Pascale&#039;s apartment studio is located in the picturesque coastal city of Biarritz in southwestern France. Keeping Pascale company is her tiny Bichon Maltese, Louise, who gets up to all kinds of mischief! She says: \&quot;I start each morning off on the right foot with a nice cup of tea, and then put on my workout clothes for an active hour-long walk along the beach. Then I start working on my art, which can alternate between painting in oils on canvas and applying gold and silver leaf.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With Pascale commissioned by clients all over the world and boasting a packed exhibition schedule, there is rarely a quiet moment and she admits the hours pass at \&quot;breakneck\&quot; speed. She does, however, make a conscious effort to look after her mental health. She explains: \&quot;My universe is in my studio in front of a canvas. When I work in front of my easel, I stay there for two or three hours at a time before taking a tea or snack break to watch a show on YouTube, which allows me to take my mind off things. So when I come back to my painting, it is with a new look and energy.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Painting on canvas with extra-fine oil, she blocks in her sketch before allowing the piece to choose its own direction. Her studio walls are adorned with drawings, photographs and images from magazines, which she uses for inspiration. Pascale&amp;rsquo;s studio assistant, while perhaps slightly furrier than most, is definitely enthusiastic. The artist says: \&quot;Louise &amp;ndash; a little four-legged creature with the muzzle of a fox, tail of a pig and snow-white fur &amp;ndash; discreetly slips into my studio and takes pleasure in trampling in my paint palette. I find her tiny footprints all over the carpet and on my bed!\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Akin to classical landscape painters like J.M.W. Turner, John Constable, Titian, Camille Pissarro and Claude Monet, he has created a vision of nature that perfectly encapsulates the thoughts and feelings of the time. His positive outlook reflects a generation who is looking to the future, and who wants to bring happiness and nostalgia into their lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Artistic license gives his vistas a fairy tale, dreamlike quality that has touched the hearts of collectors at all stages of life; from newlyweds decorating their first home, to families with children. In his early days, Paul researched the work of the Hudson River School movement, which was inspired by European Romanticism and its celebration of the emotions and aesthetics of art, music and literature. Other inspirations have included abstract art and 3D software, along with the American artist Grant Wood and the Disney&amp;nbsp;illustrator Eyvind Earle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Each of his touching scenes features magical details, including tiny flowers, winding paths and the waves of the sea. The airbrushed appearance is created with a fine paintbrush and reflects the concept of idealism. He adds: &amp;ldquo;In my paintings, existence has been stripped back down to the basics: there are no telephone wires, no street lights, no roads for cars. It&amp;rsquo;s not a real world, but a world people wish existed. Everything looks like it is meant to be there; each element is in its right place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Released in October 2021, his first book, &lt;a title=\&quot;Becoming Paul Corfield: discover the book\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/paul-corfield\/becoming-paul-corfield\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becoming Paul Corfield&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;, chronicles his growth from an up-and-coming artist in Dorset to a prolific painter with artworks in galleries nationwide. Celebrating 15 years with our publisher, the accompanying collection of exclusive limited edition prints and original artworks reimagines some of his most popular sold-out pieces from throughout his career.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Paul says: &amp;ldquo;People tell me they love my art or can picture themselves in it, which is so touching. Often, they buy it for a celebration or to remember someone they&amp;rsquo;ve loved and lost; this is very special to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Paul Corfield&#039;s Becoming collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/becoming-paul-corfield-15-years-of-magical-landscapes-book-and-artworks\&quot;&gt;Discover Paul&#039;s new &lt;em&gt;Becoming&lt;\/em&gt; collection here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Paul Corfield &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Paul works from his home studio in the heart of the Dorset countryside. His painting process starts with a small thumbnail sketch, with Paul drawing inspiration from a range of sources, including memories, photographs, and scenes from television or Instagram. After scribbling down a sketch, he plays around with the composition and then plots it out on the canvas with a grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Colour theory - mixing and combining colours to create visual effects - is integral to his work. Paul explains: \&quot;If I&amp;rsquo;m painting a sunset sky for a predominantly green landscape, I use purples and blues to really make the greens in the foreground pop. When painting a green field, I&amp;rsquo;ll underpaint it in bright pink so the little sparkles show through. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the sky and the furthest hills and work my way forward, adding the tiny dots to the trees at the very end.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To add these details, Paul uses an optivisor with&amp;nbsp;precision-ground optical glass lenses. He says: &amp;ldquo;The magnifier gives me 2.5x magnification, which allows me to perfectly space the dots so they don&amp;rsquo;t overlap. The distant trees and bushes usually have four different colours of dots: a lowlight, shadow, midtone and highlight. Distant houses in my paintings have tiny details too, especially the window frames. I can paint a tiny 1mm-wide frame with crossbars, which would be impossible without the magnifier; it&amp;rsquo;s like looking through a microscope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his materials, Paul says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I use only the best oil paints: they&amp;rsquo;re handmade with linseed oil and pigment for a long-lasting, vibrant finish. The pigment loading &amp;ndash; how intense the hue is &amp;ndash; is much higher, which stops the colours from becoming transparent and creates a beautiful richness. It may be more expensive, but it makes such a huge difference to my paintings. I try to work with sustainable materials wherever possible.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

The spectacular sights are captured in his dynamic oil paintings, which are created in textured layers on aluminium, copper, wood and canvas. Painting &lt;em&gt;en plein air&lt;\/em&gt;, he captures the mood and atmosphere of a location through light, block shapes and gestural lines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He is not inspired by any particular artists, instead evolving his own style over the last 20 years. His work has been exhibited internationally, including at Chase Contemporary in New York for the launch of &lt;em&gt;London\/New York&lt;\/em&gt; in March 2019.&amp;nbsp;Paul adds:&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I find it exhilarating to express the furious movement, artificial lights and vibrancy of a busy city centre.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Experimentation is key to his success, and his recent &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Monumental by Paul Kenton\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/paul-kenton-monumental-collection-2021\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monumental&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; release includes a rare selection of coastal and landscape scenes. In recent years, he has also experimented with exposed metal, which projects the changes in light throughout the day and transforms the piece as the viewer walks past.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His stunning &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Ascension by Paul Kenton\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/ascension\/artists\/Paul_Kenton\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ascension&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection includes two&amp;nbsp;spectacular mountainscapes that take&amp;nbsp;inspiration from a summer road trip to Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe. From Chamonix at the base of Mont Blanc, Paul travelled to the top of Aiguille du Midi, which offered spectacular panoramic views of the French, Swiss and Italian Alps.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Paul says:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;In most of my paintings I flick paint on, and it does help to create more movement.

My head is bursting with ideas for paintings. Whilst going through sketchbooks, I can rekindle the emotions and feelings of a particular scene. I paint in layers to create form until I can sense the atmosphere I want, and the structures start to emerge.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create texture, Paul manipulates the paint on his chosen surface &amp;ndash; including canvas, aluminium and wood.

Over the years, his dripping technique has become more controlled as he has experimented with the application. This has created more refined detail and sharper edges, which elevate the metallic elements and give a contemporary finish.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking about his rare inclusion of figures, he says:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;People help to create movement within a piece, but I do not go into any detail with the figures. I just try to hint at the&amp;nbsp;presence of people to capture the feeling of movement, liveliness and busyness.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Paul Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s odyssey into the world of Warhol began in 2010 when he purchased a collection of the artist&amp;rsquo;s original acetates. His ensuing collection &amp;ndash; created in collaboration with one of Warhol&amp;rsquo;s original master printers, &lt;a title=\&quot;Find out more about Alexander Heinrici\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/behind-the-scenes-of-after-warhol\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Heinrici&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; &amp;ndash; has been lauded both by the BBC and VICE Magazine.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When asked about the debate surrounding the authorship of these works, Paul says: &amp;ldquo;I like the idea of turning the art world upside down, I think Andy liked it too.&amp;rdquo; Quite so; Warhol was known for subverting accepted practices and challenging the old guard stance taken by the art world. He was unashamedly open about his hands-off approach, often not engaging with his art beyond the initial stage of working with the acetates directly. Such was his candour, he named his studio &amp;lsquo;The Factory&amp;rsquo;. There, others would print the pieces for him, and famously even sign art on his behalf. Warhol was quoted as saying: &amp;lsquo;I want other people to make my paintings &amp;hellip; I think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me.&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Arguably, Paul feels more strongly invested in replicating each stage of Warhol&amp;rsquo;s practice with unwavering conviction than the artist himself would have deemed necessary. From travelling far and wide to source the same canvases and pigments for &lt;em&gt;After Warhol&lt;\/em&gt; and working alongside Alexander Heinrici.

In his quest for authenticity, Paul tracked down the paints &amp;ndash; some dating back to the 70s and 80s &amp;ndash; that Warhol used to a little shop in London (rumoured to be &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;\/em&gt; author J.K. Rowling&amp;rsquo;s inspiration for the Ollivanders wand shop).&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside Alexander Heinrici, Paul has brought Warhol&amp;rsquo;s original acetates to life. Bought at an auction in London and authenticated by the Andy Warhol Museum, these items are the last materials to have been worked on by Warhol by hand before the mechanical process of silkscreen printing began. Faithfully following Warhol&amp;rsquo;s method, Paul blew up the original acetate before transferring the image to a larger canvas and using a squeegee to press the inks through a screen.

He later led Brazil to two more World Cup titles in 1962 (Chile) and 1970 (Mexico).&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Following a transfer to the New York Cosmos, he played an emotional farewell game at a sold-out Giants Stadium in 1977.

With light-hearted art now considered a serious art form - featuring at the Museum of Modern Art and in the Turner Prize shortlist - his fusion of classical oil painting techniques and irreverent humour gives his work a decidedly contemporary twist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Full of ingenious riddles, wordplay and visual jokes, his surreal yet adorable artworks make an incredible gift or finishing touch to a home. Adult themes of love, debauchery and gluttony are underpinned by a desire to make his collectors smile and remember \&quot;the imaginative wonderment and limitless creativity\&quot; we experienced as children, which Peter believes is \&quot;something we lost as we got a little older.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His vast collection is like flicking through a book of fairy tales: along with his own imaginary worlds, viewers are transported to scenes inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&lt;\/em&gt;.

The pair&amp;rsquo;s home is the perfect studio for their eccentric art, with quirks including a Victorian dining room and a two-foot teapot. Peter and Jayne are fond of creating a set to bring their characters to life, with Jayne using clay to form the shapes and metals and mixed media for the background. Peter in turn works mainly in oils on board for his paintings, and clay and cloth for the sculptures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the studio is a wonderland of curiosities: along with a Victorian apothecary cabinet with real medicines, Peter and Jayne share their art space with a skeleton. Used for their&amp;nbsp;Lost Impossimals&amp;trade; and Lost Alice&amp;trade; character work, this ghoulish figure is clad in a Victorian temperance sash, which was used during the social movement to prohibit alcohol. Atop its shoulder is a 1930s doll, and on its skull is a headmaster&#039;s mortar board hat, with a red wooden apple for its heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hanging on the walls are construction sketches for the Impossimal characters, along with a frame filled with an assortment of childhood memories, games and vintage artefacts. These include an old Secret Agent ID, a set of false teeth, a flintlock pistol, a belt buckle from Peter&#039;s teenage years and a box of working matches from 1903. Another quirky feature is a horse saddle, which Peter sits on to paint!&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

By layering paint, photography, and hand-lettered text, Raphael takes viewers on a documentary-style journey through geographic and emotional terrains.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The artist honed his craft in Italy, France, Amsterdam and New York. His projects have included an artwork and photo essay book with Sean &amp;lsquo;Diddy&amp;rsquo; Combs and celebrity portraiture of Benicio del Toro, Matt Damon and Susan Sarandon. In 2018, he released his first-ever collector&amp;rsquo;s edition book, &lt;em&gt;The Never-Ending Summer&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After moving to the wilderness of Connecticut, USA, Raphael was inspired to create his &lt;em&gt;Gaia&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;collection, which takes its title from the Greek goddess of nature. This breathtaking selection of hand-embellished limited edition and original works layers natural elements such as flowers and leaves with classical imagery and portraiture. Raphael&#039;s most recent series, &lt;em&gt;Grass Roots&lt;\/em&gt;, follows the internationally acclaimed artist as he journeys back through 25 years of memories from the far reaches of the Mother Continent. The collection comprises 40 originals and four limited edition signed prints.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Working on this new series felt like going through my old diaries,\&quot; explains Raphael. \&quot;All of these particular images hold great meaning and memory for me. My last collection was photographed and created during the springtime before the pandemic, focussing on beauty, warmth and the vibrant colours of nature. This collection was created over the winter months during COVID, which gave me the time to deep dive into my archives and rediscover all these special pieces.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Grass Roots 2022 by Raphael Mazzucco \&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/artists\/raphael-mazzucco#art\&quot;&gt;Discover the&amp;nbsp;Grass Roots collection by Raphael Mazzucco.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Raphael Mazzucco &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Raphael&#039;s travels encompass every iconic habitat imaginable, from the salt flats of South America to the majesty of the Serengeti.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His 2017 &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;\/em&gt; collection saw the artist transform a 2000 sq ft New Jersey shipping dock container into a darkroom. Intertwining cutting-edge photography with Japanese flora and old-school film development, the body of work simultaneously embraces the past and speaks to the future of his ever-evolving aesthetic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2018, he released&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Never-Ending Summer&lt;\/em&gt;, a collection of stunning original pieces and his first-ever collector&#039;s edition book. Featuring behind-the-scenes photography and memoirs from some of his closest confidants, it provides an intimate glimpse into the world of Raphael Mazzucco and was exhibited at the prestigious Chase Contemporary gallery during New York Fashion Week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His latest collection, &lt;em&gt;Gaia&lt;\/em&gt;, was created in Raphael&amp;rsquo;s outdoor studio and was exposed to the weather to develop like a photograph under the sun. Rustic textures are juxtaposed by daubs of colourful paint and geometric forms neatly plotted out in string like the coordinates of a map. Viewers are invited to navigate their journey through the layers of classical imagery, nostalgic photography and natural elements like feathers, flowers and leaves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Raphael says: &amp;ldquo;Anywhere and everywhere can be an inspiration.

Once outselling his peers and begged by Andy Warhol to sit for a portrait, he lost himself in his art and his tragic story was shelved in the archives of art history. Until now.

Hambleton took to cities under the cover of nightfall to situate his shadowmen in settings chosen to elicit the most startling reactions from those who passed them by. Lurking round corners, down alleyways or seemingly hovering ominously in doorways, the life-size black-silhouetted figures became a newsworthy phenomenon.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fame beckoned, and Hambleton was exhibited in institutions including the Museum of Modern Art.&amp;nbsp;After only a few years, and with over 400 shadowmen pervading the landscape of Manhattan, Hambleton took his art to Europe. Following invitations to exhibit at the Venice Biennale and paint on the Berlin Wall, interest in him had never been higher and his innate distrust of gallerists and art dealers catalysed his withdrawal from the art world. He retreated into his studio, away from the spotlight, and began a descent into poor health and substance abuse. The shadowmen&amp;rsquo;s founding father became little more than a shadow himself. Eventually living in squalor, painting to fund his drug habit and pay for food, Hambleton died of cancer in New York in October 2017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the years that have followed, Hambleton&#039;s shadowed figures have faded away, but his impact on the art world remains. An inspiration to a new generation of street artists - including Banksy and the French muralists JR and Blek le Rat - his work is just as shocking now as it was back then.&amp;nbsp;These iconic limited edition graphics, exclusive to Castle Fine Art, mark the first time since his passing that - alongside the Hambleton estate - there is a distinct movement to keep alive the undertaking that he started over forty years ago. We are privileged to bring this cultural revolution from street to canvas.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Our collection is curated from original works from the Richard Hambleton Archive, including his shadowmen paintings and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Horse and Rider&lt;\/em&gt; series. Each artwork bears the&amp;nbsp;printed impression of Hambleton&amp;rsquo;s signature on the reverse and has been replicated as a silkscreen to capture the textures and vibrancy of the original piece. The new &#039;Tribeca Rider&#039; release captures a haunting rodeo scene and is seminal to the lasting legacy of Shadowman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Find out more about our limited edition Richard Hambleton collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/shop-the-richard-hambleton-shadowman-limited-edition-collection\&quot;&gt;Find out more about the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Shadowman&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;collection on our blog&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:128,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Richard Hambleton&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Just like his shadowed figures, Hambleton preferred to exist in darkness. Whether it was stalking the streets of Manhattan with a lookout in tow, or painting frantically in his cramped and dimly-lit studio, his greatest creations were born of a darkness that pervaded his paintings. Never caught by the police, he was described by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;People&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine as &#039;a shy, ruddy-faced artist given to wandering the streets at 3 a.m. dressed in black, with jars of latex paint and a six-inch brush in his satchel.&#039;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst public art was a relatively new concept, Hambleton was already lightyears ahead of the scene. His installations came complete with a narrative, characters (a private detective called &amp;lsquo;R. Dick Trace It&amp;rsquo; and the murdered &amp;lsquo;Mr Reeee&amp;rsquo;) and a sense of a murder mystery plot playing out across the country. His &lt;em&gt;Image Mass Murder&lt;\/em&gt; series -&amp;nbsp;splatters of blood-red paint outlined in chalk in the shape of a body in 15 cities across the United States and Canada - provoked outrage, leading the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Examiner&lt;\/em&gt; to proclaim: &#039;This is the work of a sick jokester.&#039;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hambleton&#039;s canvas was international: his shadowmen appeared in the streets of Rome, London and Paris, along with the east side of the Berlin Wall. His contrast between light and shadow followed him into his everyday life; in between painting in a disused petrol station, using blood from discarded syringes, and exchanging his artworks for food, he worked with&amp;nbsp;the fashion designer&amp;nbsp;Giorgio Armani, who said: &amp;ldquo;I have long been a fan of Richard Hambleton. Richard&amp;rsquo;s work is of the streets, and for me stands as a reminder that art in all its forms is first and foremost driven by individual passion and creativity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Shadowman&lt;\/em&gt; collection is now available online and in galleries.

Unlike canvas, glass interacts with the light, bringing the painting to life. Changing the lights and ambience in your room will create different effects, echoing the transformative power of natural phenomena like the northern lights, sunrise and lightning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The exhilarating unpredictability of nature has taken Richard around the world. His &lt;em&gt;Aurora Borealis&lt;\/em&gt; collection saw him travel to Iceland, where, accompanied by a local photographer and filmmaker, he drove out into the wild terrains to capture the wide skies, shooting rays, magical glow and hypnotic dancing of light. Closer to home, he explores the British landscape with his wife and two children, who are often symbolised in his paintings by four birds or stars. Through each artwork, he hopes to make viewers feel alive and want to \&quot;roam the land, fly in the sky, search for the stars.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Richard&#039;s landscapes are so detailed that they are often mistaken for photographs, when in fact each one has been meticulously painted by hand using his &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Richard Rowan&#039;s painting technique\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/artists\/richard-rowan#from-the-studio\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reverse painting technique&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;. Classical influences include the work of J.M.W. Turner and even Michelangelo. Painted&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;en plein air&lt;\/em&gt; (outside) like the Impressionist painters of the late 19th century, his artworks evoke the passion and drama of the Romantic movement, along with the storytelling element of the Renaissance. Like the Dutch artists of the 17th century, Richard emphasises clouds in his skyscapes, while his focus on light and the effects of the weather echoes the work of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Commemorating 15 years with our publisher, Washington Green Fine Art, Richard&#039;s new hardback book and gicl&amp;eacute;e prints take viewers on a journey through his powerful skyscapes.

He says: \&quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve revisited all the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to achieve over the years; goals I set myself for mastering new techniques and introducing new elements into my work. This collection is a culmination of where I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted my artwork to go.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Richard adds: &amp;ldquo;The great thing about doing shows and meeting people is discovering how they see the work. Some people are in tears looking at it, while others say it was in their home for a dinner party and it got them talking about art all night. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that it can go from something that decorates a house to sparking a conversation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop the Richard Rowan collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Richard_Rowan\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Shop Richard&#039;s full collection here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:116,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Richard Rowan &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Richard&#039;s studio is at the end of the garden at his Victorian house near Wimbledon. From where he stands, he can see his children playing in the house and garden; this is important to him, as he wants them to be a part of his creative journey. His son&#039;s fear of lightning inspired him to paint artworks depicting this natural phenomenon, whilst his daughter&#039;s panoramic photographs pushed him to explore his scenes from different viewpoints. His family are also represented in his paintings by stars and birds.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He is known for his back-to-front painting technique, whereby he paints in oils on the opposite side of the glass. Used by decorative painters in the 19th century to embellish luxury furnishings, this painstaking method sees Richard completely reverse the traditional painting layers, starting with the foreground and the finer details before working backwards into the background. To achieve this, he has created his own tools, including cutting the handles of paintbrushes so he can work underneath the glass. The glass is baked in a makeshift box after each layer, where it dries out over two weeks before Richard scratches out the paint and removes layers with a palette knife to add detail.

Wherever he is in the world, he takes reference photographs and sketches, which he transforms when painting his finished work. Each original painting becomes littered with post-it notes as Richard adds details and ideas. All of his pieces are created whilst listening to music, which can include anything from classical piano by the Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi to songs from the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;\/em&gt; soundtrack. You can find out which song Richard listened to by clicking on the individual artwork.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Richard says: &amp;ldquo;I do like to challenge myself with difficult work. Painting in oil on glass can make you want to tear your hair out, but it is also satisfying at the same time. When I sit down to paint, I want to paint better than the last time; pushing the boundaries of what I can do. Once I finish a painting, I want people to look at the piece and be drawn in and find themselves in my work.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

George bought many of his prints for both himself and cast and crew members.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\&quot; mb-12 \&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Horror fans will love Robert&#039;s selection of spine-tingling drawings from classic films like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A Nightmare on Elm Street&lt;\/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An American Werewolf in London&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;\/em&gt;, while movie buffs will recognise scenes from more cult classics. He has also created a range of artworks inspired by the TV shows&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;\/em&gt;, which have been signed by the actors William Shatner and Lou Ferrigno.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a licensed Marvel artist, he has depicted iconic Spider-Man and Avengers scenes. Collectors of his &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;\/em&gt; pieces include Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Tom Cruise and the late Carrie Fisher.

Known as &lt;em&gt;hachure&lt;\/em&gt; in French, it may look messy but it&amp;rsquo;s a very controlled technique. The distance between the hatching marks determine how light or dark that area appears.&amp;nbsp;Notable adopters of hatching include Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Edgar Degas.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

His signature &amp;lsquo;drip&amp;rsquo; effect is created by letting paint run down the canvas before building up colour with successively thicker application. This gives his work a hallucinatory feel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: \&quot;The more I can throw down and the more abstract the shapes are, the more enjoyable the battle is.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock said that if he planned a painting, he&amp;rsquo;d never make a mark. My work depends on spontaneity and a free association: I don&amp;rsquo;t really need an inspiration, I just do it.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While painting, he listens to music, natural history documentaries and true crime podcasts. Along with his conservation work &amp;ndash; which includes donating an artwork to raise money for the Koala Hospital in South Wales after the Australian bushfires &amp;ndash; his passion for learning more about the environment feeds into every piece he paints.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Robert has a studio in a cotton mill in Stockport, Greater Manchester, which is open to the public, and a studio at home, where he creates his art. Waking up early, he takes his dog out before painting from around 8.30am to 5pm.&amp;nbsp;He also developed a new passion for flora during the recent COVID-19 crisis. &amp;ldquo;At the beginning of lockdown, I fell in love with houseplants,&amp;rdquo; he reveals. &amp;ldquo;I think I wanted to bring the outdoors inside. I&amp;rsquo;ve collected around 40 specimens in various shapes and sizes.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt; .&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Here, she saw a baby hippo in the wild and visited elephants at an orphanage. This, combined with her love of Disney, sparked a passion for capturing the unique characters of animals. She is also inspired by Leonardo da Vinci and strong female figures like the Suffragettes.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After graduating with a first-class degree in chemistry with forensic science and toxicology, she set herself a one-year challenge to make it as an artist &amp;ndash; ultimately attracting the attention of our publisher, Washington Green. Her debut collection, &lt;em&gt;Circle of Life&lt;\/em&gt;, is named after &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;\/em&gt; and features circular forms to evoke happy emotions and symbolise how everything in life is connected.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An advanced open water diver, she has dived in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Egypt. She is also an award-winning powerlifter and is currently working towards getting her private pilot&amp;rsquo;s licence. She owns a 1968 VW Beetle named Pumpkin, whom she is lovingly restoring back to his former glory.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Roxy says: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all about nature&amp;rsquo;s way of taking and giving back to the Earth. Animals are there for you no matter what.

Although she occasionally creates a quick sketch of her idea, she often heads straight to the workshop to start bringing the sculpture to life.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;She adds: &amp;ldquo;Each day in the workshop is different to the last. Some days I might be sculpting, and others I can be making lost-wax casts, welding or chasing the bronze works. I am able to do every part of the process, from the very start of sculpting to the final patinated bronze.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Behind Roxy&amp;rsquo;s art is a fascination with the way the world works. Amazed by how changing just one molecular bond can alter a state, she uses her scientific knowledge to formulate her own patinas. Different heats and chemicals create a unique reaction that cannot be replicated. As a result, each of the studio editions has a unique finish. The colours are muted to reflect Roxy&amp;rsquo;s belief that art should be ever-lasting and live within the home. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:21464,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:21465,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;RWI &quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:60536,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:55,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;scarlett-raven&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:38&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2021-08-24 11:46:54&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Scarlett Raven&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Owned by celebrities including the Hollywood actor Orlando Bloom, Scarlett&#039;s textured landscape paintings have positioned her as one of the most exciting female artists in the UK today.

Her father was the late saxophonist Raphael Ravenscroft, who played with acts like ABBA, Pink Floyd, Tina Turner and Marvin Gaye. Encouraged by her model mother, Scarlett explored her artistic side as an escape from her struggle with dyslexia. Following her first solo exhibition on Cork Street, London, at the age of just 21, her career took off and she has since been featured by titles such as &lt;em&gt;ES Magazine&lt;\/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Tate Etc&lt;\/em&gt;.,&lt;em&gt;Tatler&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Time Out&lt;\/em&gt;.

Her landscape works are a way for her to explore the geometry of nature, with elements like water and stars adding a feeling of serenity. Framed in a sustainable wood, all of her limited edition artworks are hand-embellished to echo the multilayered feel of her original paintings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Scarlett says: &amp;ldquo;Paint is thrown on, splattered and flicked. Spitting and dancing, it creates a whole world of magic.&amp;nbsp;When people look at these paintings, I want them to feel themselves. I want them to provide somewhere to feel alive, a place to breathe and explore.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover Scarlett&#039;s latest selection of hand-signed limited edition prints and original mixed media paintings&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=\&quot;I am Reborn | Scarlett Raven\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/scarlett-raven-i-am-reborn-landscape-paintings-inspired-by-motherhood\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:119,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Scarlett Raven&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Scarlett often has company in her studio, in the form of her baby son Harvey and her adorable dog&amp;nbsp;Dal&amp;iacute; (named after the Surrealist painter Salvador&amp;nbsp;Dal&amp;iacute;). While creating her new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;I am Reborn | Scarlett Raven\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/scarlett-raven-i-am-reborn-landscape-paintings-inspired-by-motherhood\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am Reborn&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; collection, she was inspired by her son&#039;s innate curiosity and the awakening of his senses. She reveals: \&quot;Harvey has helped me to see things clearly again. I watch how he sees colours, shapes, smells and sounds, and how he&amp;rsquo;s loving and accepting of all of his senses. My son has inspired me to look at things like I did when I was a child.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;She creates tactile art by covering her hands in oil pigment and gently feeling her way around the surface. Working with Winsor &amp;amp; Newton paints, her three favourite colours are Cobalt Turquoise Light, Cobalt Violet and Quinacridone Magenta. Splattering paint on the canvas captures the movement of flowers in the wind. She explains: \&quot;The movement must be in every layer, so when you step back you feel like the landscape is alive. It&#039;s the magic of knowing that something beautiful is about to happen.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Scarlett adds: \&quot;Composition and colour are the new driving forces in my art; I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how they create movement through the eyes of the viewer. I live a lot in an imaginary world of colour, and this is my way of understanding geometry and the science of patterns and shapes. Nature has a higher intelligence, and a remarkable language of its own. My paintings are a portal to a magical, safe place where anything is possible. The movement, freshness and energy take my breath away and provide beautiful escapism.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/youtu.be\/z-LlS-wuljE&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10720,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10719,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;SRA&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:40314,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:130,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;steve-winterburn&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-10-18 09:26:36&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-10-24 14:35:58&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Steve Winterburn &quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p class=\&quot;MsoNormal\&quot; style=\&quot;margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #000000;\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: #34495e; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\&quot;&gt;Steve Winterburn&#039;s legendary sculptures feature in public installations, galleries, and collectors&#039; homes across the nation.

Being a trustee of conservation organisations such as &lt;em&gt;Care for the Wild International&lt;\/em&gt; has allowed him to explore the globe and gain first-hand familiarity with the animals that he sculpts. Through observation and experimentation with the process and materials, he immortalises his chosen species in bronze. &amp;ldquo;When I first got into wildlife I was drawing and painting. Sculpture took it to a whole new level. I needed to understand the anatomy and the movement of the animal in its entirety; how it feels, how it moves, the magic of that animal, and not many people understand that.&amp;rdquo;- Steve Winterburn.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Capturing the power, beauty, strength and resilience of these animals &amp;ndash; including horses, cheetahs, tigers and gorillas &amp;ndash; the self-taught artist&#039;s detailed busts are brought to life through an age-old process of bronze casting, in a medium that he says is as &amp;lsquo;eternal as diamonds&amp;rsquo;&amp;trade;. His belief that the eyes are the gateway to the animals&amp;rsquo; souls adds emotion and intrigue to his work.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, Steve has developed his own techniques, with every sculpture created in the family-run foundry. He applies a patina to each sculpture by hand, giving it a unique feel. The looseness of the finish allows him to concentrate on expressing the soul of the animal. He adds: &amp;ldquo;All these animals captivate me in their own way. They are beautiful majestic beings yet at the same time incredibly dangerous and demand respect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After selling his work at Christie&amp;rsquo;s, Sotheby&amp;rsquo;s, Harrods and Selfridges, Steve&amp;rsquo;s profile continues to grow. Most recently, in July 2021, his statue of the legendary rugby player John Holmes was unveiled at the Emerald Headingly Stadium in Leeds. He has also exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and painted the late Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Steve says: &amp;ldquo;Eyes are so important to me because &amp;lsquo;eyes are the doorway to the soul&amp;rsquo;. When you see animals in the wild, you judge everything from their eyes. There is a real clarity in them. You can see if they are happy, angry, agitated and many other emotions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover the Steve Winterburn collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Steve_Winterburn\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Shop Steve Winterburn&#039;s latest sculptures here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Steve Winterburn &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Steve&#039;s innate understanding of engineering and design enables him to explore his passion for challenge and experimentation. In 2002, he set up his own studio in Yorkshire, where he personally shapes each piece from conception to completion. This is unusual in itself, as the different stages - including mould-making, mixing the patina and refining the final shape with hammers - are traditionally completed by a succession of highly-skilled artists, each of whom is a specialist in their particular area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His sculptures are cast in bronze using the lost-wax process. Also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cire perdue&lt;\/em&gt;, this is a method of metal casting whereby a molten metal is poured into a mould that has been created with a wax model. Once the mould is created, the wax model is melted and drained away. The patina (a thin coloured layer that forms on the surface of the bronze due to oxidisation and other chemical processes) is an important part of the finished look, helping to bring the animal to life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Experimentation is key to his work, as he explains: \&quot;After a trip to Greece and seeing sculptures by the masters, I was inspired to sculpt so that I could create &#039;reality&#039;. Over the years, my style has evolved: it has progressed from &#039;modelled&#039; work with a great amount of detail, to my current style, which is a lot looser. This is because I now understand the anatomy and have gained confidence, which has allowed me to be more expressive with my art.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&#039;s research and conservation projects have seen him learn from a tiger guru in India and handle cheetah cubs in Africa. Recalling one particular experience tracking gorillas in the mountains of Rwanda, he says: \&quot;It was truly overwhelming to be in the presence of such a magnificent creature. It was amazing to see how the family groups reacted to us in their space. We had days of fun watching the babies play and having them jump all over us. However, things did turn a bit scary when a big male took a disliking to us being there; he started&amp;nbsp;beating his chest and screaming at us, which echoed through the Virunga Mountains. We had to become submissive very quickly!\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about Steve&#039;s artistic process, you can learn more about him and his amazing artistic family &lt;a href=\&quot;https:\/\/castlefineart.foleon.com\/steve-winterburn\/steve-winterburn\/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;text-decoration: underline;\&quot;&gt;here&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=63z9HVC2zog&amp;list=PLrXCYs1aZ9KbCh_4SdUzasrxgkuX8uf8F&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:12459,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:12460,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;SWI&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;current&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:61923,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:0},{&quot;id&quot;:39,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;stuart-mcalpine-miller&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:23&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2021-10-01 08:22:27&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Stuart McAlpine Miller&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Scottish artist Stuart regularly hits the headlines with his Pop Art paintings.

Using subtle tones of paint, he creates the illusion of transparency. The overall effect is similar to looking through a glass bottle, distorting the image and presenting a different version of the same subject. In turn, a far-fetched reality is created, highlighting the unrealistic expectations of today&amp;rsquo;s society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Previously commissioned by Paul McCartney, Stuart has worked with brands including the BBC, McVitie&#039;s, Persil, Renault and Virgin.&amp;nbsp;As the current artist-in-residence at the Kimpton Charlotte Square Hotel and a former artist-in-residence at The Savoy in London, Stuart has also enjoyed successful exhibitions and commissions in New York, Italy and Hong Kong.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He is an admirer of Old Masters such as Caravaggio and Hieronymus Bosch, but is particularly inspired by the leading founder of the Pop Art movement, Andy Warhol, explaining: &amp;ldquo;Warhol&amp;rsquo;s views on mass consumerism and the way he translated these into his art is something I really relate to. I hope my art does something similar and stands the test of time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Past collections include &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop A Time for Reflection: The Savoy Suite by Stuart McAlpine Miller\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/timeless-elegance-at-the-savoy\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Time For Reflection: The Savoy Suite&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;, which featured in the ITV documentary&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Savoy&lt;\/em&gt; in 2020.&amp;nbsp;Offering a unique insight into the hotel&#039;s patrons - including Alfred Hitchcock, Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin - the pieces take viewers on a tour behind its&amp;nbsp;doors and into the lives of Hollywood&#039;s great.

Stuart says: \&quot;It&amp;rsquo;s almost like a visual arts version of a time capsule, preserving moments to be enjoyed long after we&amp;rsquo;re all gone.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ironically fitting for his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=\&quot;Revelations: A Portrait of Magic | Stuart McAlpine Miller\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/revelations-a-portrait-of-magic-stuart-mcalpine-miller-harry-potter-paintings\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelations: A Portrait of Magic&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection, Stuart&#039;s art studio is inside a beautiful riverside castle in Callander, Scotland. Situated in the attic, this state-of-the-art space has skylight windows to provide plenty of natural light. His original artworks - often mistakenly believed to be computer-generated - are painted in oils by hand, with the sharp lines and illusion of transparency heightened by a colourist&#039;s touch. They are then photographed, scanned and digitally manipulated before Stuart uses this new artwork as a remastered base for the final kaleidoscopic layer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The BBC and Radio 2 art critic Estelle Lovatt has praised the &#039;supernatural realism&#039; of Stuart&#039;s work, adding: \&quot;McAlpine Miller has one of the&amp;nbsp;most creative minds in art today, and he&amp;rsquo;s established a process that follows no Masters. Looking at his&amp;nbsp;canvas is like watching a video game featuring Peter Max scuffling with Basquiat and&amp;nbsp;Keith Haring scrapping with Ed Ruscha.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his own creative process, Stuart says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s always important to keep reimagining your ideas and learning from every piece that you paint. Painting is disconcerting, in some respects: it&amp;rsquo;s almost like an apocalypse has happened, and the character doesn&amp;rsquo;t know why they&amp;rsquo;re there. It&amp;rsquo;s an amalgamation of stories reinvented for a new audience.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

At the age of seven, he began to create imagery using an ATARI&amp;reg; 130XE&amp;trade; computer. Because of his dyslexia, visual imagery was his way of understanding the world, with television programmes and films having a huge impact on his creative style. He says: &amp;ldquo;I would watch TV for hours, absorbing it all. The colours seemed so bright.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After studying IT and computers in Warsaw, he moved to London, where he finished his education at Kingston University and became an assistant for Mat Collishaw, a prominent member of the Young British Artists alongside Damien Hirst. At the same time, 3D-printing technology was becoming more popular and affordable, which gave him the freedom to combine his technical knowledge and artistic 3D experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His &lt;em&gt;POPek&lt;\/em&gt; series of balloon dogs initially began as a parody of the contemporary American artist Jeff Koons. This quickly evolved into different poses, including yoga dogs, along with urinating and defecating dogs. The collection hit the headlines in 2012, when the London Underground failed to see the funny side and banned his art from the &lt;em&gt;Art Below&lt;\/em&gt; exhibition at their underground stations for being &#039;offensive&#039;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For his &lt;em&gt;Gone&lt;\/em&gt; series, Sebastian has brought to life a selection of childhood heroes,&amp;nbsp;including Mickey Mouse, Lisa Simpson, Winnie-the-Pooh and Buzz Lightyear.&amp;nbsp;These haunting, shadowed images indicate his interest in &amp;ldquo;the dark side&amp;rdquo;, while symbolising a deep-rooted sense of nostalgia. He explains: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s showing our childhood heroes reaching out to us with an extended hand and saying, &amp;ldquo;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m still here, do you remember me?&amp;rdquo;. Or if those are fading memories, they are saying goodbye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Both a thought-provoking conversation piece and a symbol of the turbulent lives we live in, his new &#039;Riot of Liberty&#039; sculpture draws upon the protests that took place across the USA, Hong Kong and Chile between 2019 and 2020. The pose of the Statue of Liberty is deliberately reminiscent of Banksy&amp;rsquo;s famous &amp;lsquo;Flower Thrower&amp;rsquo; artwork (also known as &amp;lsquo;Love in the Air&amp;rsquo;), which was created in Bethlehem to advocate for peace.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The artist&amp;rsquo;s work is on permanent display at the Singapore Science Centre, and is shown at art fairs across the globe, from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, New York and London. In 2021, four of his large-scale dogs were on display at Covent Garden in central London, raising &amp;pound;1,160 for the Blue Cross pet charity. The installation has currently taken over the Westgate shopping centre in Oxford, where you can help us to donate &amp;pound;1 by adding a post to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #castle4bluecross.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sebastian says: &amp;ldquo;I would describe my work as innovative, modern Pop Art. My work fits exactly where we are now in this modern Pop Art world.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Whatshisname&#039;s latest artworks\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Whatshisname\&quot;&gt;Shop Whatshisname&#039;s latest limited edition prints and sculptures here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:123,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Whatshisname&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Our team took a trip to Sebastian&#039;s studio in Tooting, London (watch the video below!) to get the inside scoop on the creative processes for his &lt;em&gt;POPek&lt;\/em&gt; dogs. The first thing we saw was a huge bookcase full of his balloon dogs in different colours, variations and poses, which he told us is \&quot;...a reminder of where I am now, and what is in the pipelines.\&quot; There was also art by artists he is inspired by. along with books on all aspects of art, advertising, video games and pop culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Next, he took us into an adjoining room, where he pins all of his ideas, inspirations and Pop Art references to a wall to help him decide on an initial design. He also keeps a notebook with sketches from over the years, with each design dated so he knows exactly how long it took from the initial concept to the final sculpture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first step of the production or design process is creating a 3D model. He explains: \&quot;Because my background is in graphics, I always start with a 3D model so I can look the design from every angle. The next step is using a 3D printer to create small versions of the design. What looks good on a computer screen doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily translate well for the physical model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Once I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this, I will create a large-scale 3D printed model. They are printed in various parts, so each part can be moulded and cast in resin. Sometimes I will cast the entire balloon dog as one piece. Depending on its complexity, the design may be divided into many different smaller pieces, which are then assembled. I will play around at this stage, testing the colours and seeing what looks good or not.\&quot;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Following this, Sebastian creates a second mould for the balloon dog. This has silicone fibreglass on the outside, and a silicone &amp;lsquo;jacket&amp;rsquo; on the inside. He pours resin through the hole, plugs it and uses a rotomoulding technique, which involves slowly rotating it so the liquid sticks to the walls of the mould. As a result, a hollow figure is formed. When he opens the mould, inside is a perfectly-cast model of the sculpture, which is ready for cleaning, sanding, priming and then spraying. A clear gloss is then applied for a lustrous finish.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.

Powerful sunrises suggest a bright future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To give the background a ghostlike quality, the underpainting is predominantly blue and then each subsequent layer is warmer than the last to lift the painting and create the illusion of mist.

There is nothing better than being able to sit outside with a glass of wine or whisky with classical music playing in the background.

The boom of graffiti culture in the early 1990s piqued D13ego&amp;rsquo;s interest in a new medium: spray paint.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Quoting the pop art father Roy Lichtenstein amongst his major influences, the economics and maths graduate describes his style as &amp;lsquo;urban pop&amp;rsquo; and often includes financial symbols. His art is born out of a love of retro comics and was originally created as a graffiti series on the streets of London.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;D13ego says:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;My technique consists of painstakingly hand-cutting layers of up to 30 stencils, which I then spray-paint on canvas or wood panels.

When satisfied, she uses the background to create the world the character embodies. Alternately obliterating and refining the image brings further energy and movement. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Emma says:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;My art stems from an emotion or energy that I want to convey on the canvas from within.

She explains: \&quot;It&#039;s very important for me to always have music playing when I create art, as it evokes emotion and intensifies the process. It usually has a similar feel to the piece I&#039;m painting; for instance, if I want to produce a high-energy piece I will play high-tempo music.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After sketching out the composition with a pencil, she considers tonal qualities. Often she starts with monotone colours to establish the light and shadows early on. A graphic design graduate, she regularly experiments with colours in Photoshop before deciding on the final palette. Once satisfied, she uses the background to establish the world the character embodies - often working on the floor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Emma explains: \&quot;It is a very expressive and intuitive part of the process. My main aim at this point is to intensify the emotion of the piece by bringing energy and movement.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lMuliO-h3Lc&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10789,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10788,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;EGR&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6546,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:12,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;govinder-nazran&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:15:47&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2018-09-14 13:15:18&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Govinder Nazran&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Govinder&#039;s striking, na&amp;iuml;ve depictions of the feline and canine form won him thousands of fans across the globe.

A career as a photographic director beckoned, and led him to lead fashion shoots around the world. After moving to his hometown of Saltaire in West Yorshire, he freelanced for major publishing companies to create card designs. He was soon discovered by our publishing company, Washington Green, and became one of our most popular artists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Charming, moving and funny, Govinder had an indisputable talent for brightening up the dullest day or greyest spirit with his imagination. Many of his paintings were inspired by the concepts of &#039;good&#039; and &#039;evil&#039;, &#039;innocence&#039; and &#039;malevolence&#039;.

Using a rich colour palette, Hamish paints with finesse while creating a tactile surface achieved with layer upon layer of heavily-applied pigment.

And it is none other than his wife Gail! The artist explains: \&quot;We men folk have a lot to learn, and I have learned a great deal from her since we met. My art celebrates that mystifying blend of feminine beauty and strength. While loyal to that enduring genre of the celebrated nude and venerated goddess in art, I also explore the majesty of a woman&#039;s presence.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The artist&#039;s love of women has seen him explore themes of empowerment, narcissism and even &#039;smartphone mania&#039;.

For Jeff, rain symbolised washing away history and starting afresh, marking the start of a new journey. His figures are deliberately unidentifiable so viewers can relate to them.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create his pieces, Jeff took photographs for reference before sketching the characters in a book. He painted the scene without rain and then added the couple in, before painting on the rain with a dry DIY emulsion brush.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jeff said:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m never happier than when I&amp;rsquo;ve got a paintbrush in my hand.

This curiosity shone through in his work, and harked back to his time on a market stall, where he&#039;d meet interesting characters and uncover more about their past.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His varied career also included stints as an accident investigator and at an oil rig, where he was known as the &amp;lsquo;toilet artist&amp;rsquo; due to his penchant for sketching caricatures of workmates on the toilet walls!&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jeff often enlisted the help of two of his close friends to create realistic scenes. After posing the pair in the signature 50s clothing in his studio or a local park, Jeff used to take several photographs of them before using these for reference when sketching. He said at the time: \&quot;I use my instinct when selecting colours.

It was here that her multimedia creations began to take shape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards, she embarked on her &lt;em&gt;New Shoes&lt;\/em&gt; sculpture range, which won an award from the GWIIN (Global Women&#039;s Innovators and Inventors Network). This enabled her to begin the exciting journey of moving her sassy ladies from her work bench into the gallery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Joanne loves to people-watch and takes much of her inspiration from those around her. She might spot a particular look, or a slight stance or movement that rouses her to pick up a pencil and document it.

The vivid colours and lively scenes of surrounding advertising posters offered a glimpse into a happy and exciting world &amp;ndash; something that would follow him into his adult life.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After years spent working in the coal mines, he held his first solo art show at the age of 26. Joe quickly made a name for himself with his multicoloured paintings, which feature anonymous four-inch figures and scenes inspired by the 1950s and 60s. Since then, he has exhibited at Museums Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University, and in 2008 was awarded a star on Sheffield&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Walk of Fame&amp;rsquo;.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create his energetic pieces, Joe first paints the canvas orange &amp;ndash; which Impressionist masters like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir did to create movement. He then sketches in the figures with a pencil, holding it similarly to a screwdriver. Raw umber is applied, before dark lines are added once the paint is dry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Joe says: &amp;ldquo;The colours are like dancers: they all want to be seen. My art is based on repertory theatre and the drama of real life. I set my characters in vistas my audience will enjoy, and I always want to put on a good show.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Joe Scarborough&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a taste of what the painter has been up to recently!

Painting revealed a whole new world of colour and texture, and even now, over 40 years later, he uses the same easel. Inspirations include artists like Banksy and L.S. Lowry, along with his own family. In fact, his stick figure characters are adapted from his daughter&amp;rsquo;s scribbles.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a world of digital trickery and special effects, it takes a true artist to conjure an illusion with a trusty paintbrush and canvas. All of John&amp;rsquo;s three-dimensional artworks are originally painted by hand without any digital images or tracing. He does this by painting a perspective in reverse: the parts on the canvas farthest from your eyes are the largest, and the parts closer to your eyes are smaller. As you stand away from the painting, the farthest parts seem to come forwards, and the nearest parts appear to move backwards, reversing the whole picture and creating a 3D effect.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;From cityscapes to beach scenes, art galleries and fantasy worlds, John experiments with a range of compositions. He often features elements from seminal works by other artists, including Vincent van Gogh&#039;s post-impressionist backgrounds,&amp;nbsp;Ren&amp;eacute; Magritte&#039;s bowler hat figure and Banksy&#039;s street art.&amp;nbsp;For the full spectrum of movement, his artworks are best hung with the centre at eye level.&amp;nbsp;Simply step from left to right to see the magic for yourself!&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;John says: &amp;ldquo;Picasso once said that he spent his life trying to paint like a child. This inspired me to mix children&amp;rsquo;s art with the carefully-planned paintings of an adult artist.&amp;nbsp;I always look at things through rose-coloured glasses. I like to look for the good in things, and I try to depict this in my paintings.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover original art by John D Wilson\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/John_D_Wilson\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can discover John&#039;s newest original 3D paintings here&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of John D Wilson &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;John achieves an incredible texture on his artworks by working with paintbrushes, palette knives, toothbrushes and even a meat skewer! He says: \&quot;As an artist, you can never say that you know it all. Every day you are experimenting with something&amp;hellip; colours, texture or subject. Whatever it may be, it&amp;rsquo;s what makes this job so exciting.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I always have to bear in mind the effect that reverse perspective will have on what I want to paint.&amp;nbsp;When painting a gallery scene, it can be difficult to get any depth into a picture. I try to achieve this by painting layers of the walls getting farther back, giving the appearance of depth on a flat canvas.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;John works from his home studio in New Zealand and enjoys walking along the beaches nearby. He reveals:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;My studio is like a magnet to me: every time I walk past the door and get that smell of linseed and turpentine, I&amp;rsquo;m drawn inside. Painting now takes up most of my time: I go to bed thinking of my latest painting, and wake up with ideas for the next.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular &lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt; feature in &lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt; magazine.

Little did he know that he would one day work as a designer and developer for the global phenomenon!&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Learning to draw by posing and sketching his toys or copying from popular comic strips like Charles M. Schulz&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;\/em&gt;, John also became fascinated by the special effects of blockbuster films and the stop-motion clay animation of Aardman Animations, famed for their &lt;em&gt;Wallace and Gromit&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;series. When LEGO released their famous Minifigures in 1978 he was bewitched by their bold colours and blank stares, and these themes later influenced his work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Following his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Art Institute of Chicago, the American artist joined LEGO as a designer before developing their LEGO Club Magazine. He worked on their &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;\/em&gt; project in 2003 and led the development of their &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;\/em&gt; series from 2008. In total, he made over 70 TV commercials and helped to create LEGO&#039;s first-ever CGI cartoon. He now works in the aerospace industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Abstract Impressionism and his young daughter&amp;rsquo;s artistic self-expression, John&amp;rsquo;s paintings allow the original pencil sketches to live in the layers of paint. Recognisable characters are presented as both entire beings and a unique combination of shapes, patterns and colour.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of John McCormack &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;John spent his childhood drawing toys and recreating comic strips, and these memories inspire his art today. He says: \&quot;Seeing them come to life through animation got me hooked on the medium. Anything was possible, and the vibrant colours and relatable stories made me want to be a storyteller.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;His lifelong fascination with patterns made LEGO the perfect muse for his colourful acrylic paintings. In particular, he enjoys how the simple brick shapes can create something magical when combined. The artists he admires are those who challenge perceptions&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; including Jeremy Mann, Alex Kanevsky and Jessica Brilli&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and he tries to do this within his own work.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To add energy, he allows the pencil lines to show through the layers of paint. This was inspired by his young daughter, who once took it upon herself to embellish one of his paintings. He explains: \&quot;She found some oil pastels that I had in my studio and drew all over it. At first, I was angry. But then I realised that she had brought an energy to my painting, so I left her marks. It was kind of a revelatory moment for me in terms of freeing myself up to be more emotional with mark-making.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Behind each of his artworks is a desire to bring the joy of childhood to his audience. John adds: \&quot;Memories are so vivid that they sometimes become colours and patterns. To see the way it makes people happy&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; these simple little bricks&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; is something that just brings joy in trying to capture it.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/342881653&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:16424,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:16426,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;JMC&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:15508,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:18,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;joy-kirton-smith&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:15:56&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2018-09-14 13:49:18&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Joy Kirton Smith&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Joy&#039;s striking artworks are inspired by the Italian Renaissance and are perfect for any art history fan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;banner_id&quot;:10908,&quot;meta_title&quot;:&quot;Joy Kirton Smith &quot;,&quot;meta_description&quot;:&quot;Find out more about the artist Joy Kirton Smith at Castle Fine Art.

His ideas begin with hand-drawn scribbles before they are developed as a storyboard. Once he is happy with the composition, Keith paints using layer upon layer of graphite, acrylic, oil and soft pastel.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Recent influences include fictional soldiers and police from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;films, and the changing roles of women in society. He often includes political symbols such as the British flag to incite conversation.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Keith says:&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I am not after perfection, I paint from the heart and strive for emotion and feeling in my work. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about putting paint on a canvas &amp;ndash; I want people to feel the painting, whatever the subject may be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Keith Maiden &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Keith&#039;s first step is to form ideas using hand-drawn scribbles, before progressing to slightly more detailed sketches. With a rough idea in his head or on paper, he develops it as a storyboard, similarly to a cartoonist. Once the story works with the sketch, he starts to paint.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The piece is created in white acrylic paint with a brush and palette knives. After this has dried, he adds up to eight layers of graphite and acrylic before finally adding oil and soft pastel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: \&quot;A lot of my work is storytelling. It sometimes takes longer to create the story of a painting than to paint the piece itself. It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult process that takes time, research and endless scribbles and sketches to bring everything together.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10825,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10826,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;KMA&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6702,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:67,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;laura-tinald&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:49&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2018-09-14 14:02:13&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Laura Tinald&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Artist and illustrator Laura uses Indian ink to bring life to her sketches of the female form.

Inspired by this piece, Laura spent hours drawing women with long, flowing locks to capture the same texture.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst Laura uses a variety of materials, she has a particular love for Indian ink on Fabriano hot pressed watercolour paper. This is rooted in her early discovery of illustrators like Quentin Blake and Ralph Steadman.

She explains:&amp;nbsp;\&quot;I was amazed that something so ugly during the day could become so beautiful at night. Its strange orange night glow is like an alien world, or a city such as New York.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To capture her scenes, the artist uses her camera as a sketchbook for her ideas. She then takes elements from each photograph to create a composition. Working with enamels and oils, she experiments with different textures and effects. She starts with a bright base coat of red, yellow and white to give her artworks a glow. The painting is then built up in a series of layers, which she often peels back to give it depth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lesley Anne says: \&quot;I love the hustle and bustle of city streets at night. My father worked at the BP plant for 30 years and would take my friends and I on tours to see the lights at night. I aim to evoke feelings within the viewer, allowing them to step into these scenes.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:null,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10836,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10833,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;LAD&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:10927,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:22,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;louis-sidoli&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:15:59&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2019-04-30 16:08:32&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Louis Sidoli&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Challenging the very definition of art, Louis&#039; iconic portraits transform what we may perceive as trash into a very modern treasure.

Working without drawings or mock-ups ensures that each piece is uniquely-crafted, with a mesmerising finish that glitters in the sun.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Malcom says: &amp;ldquo;My journey into sculpture started many years ago. I was unaware that the trade I had decided to train in would lead me to the sculptures I create today. I hope my artworks make people smile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Malcolm Barrett &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp; creates his original pieces by carving a piece of expanding foam then spreading over a filler to create the final shape. Once he&#039;s happy, he sprays it with primer and then creates a fibreglass or rubber mould which will then be encased with a fibreglass outer shell. The piece is first sprayed silver and then the primary colour, followed by several coats of lacquer - all of which are applied by hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He says: \&quot;It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple: I dream it, think it over and then simply sculpt it. There&amp;rsquo;s no mock-up and no drawings. As a panel beater and sprayer, I&amp;rsquo;m used to creating large, smooth shapes and finishing them off with a nice coat of car paint. I have no training in sculpture at all, but I have done lots of experimenting!\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:10640,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:10639,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;MBA&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:6695,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:98,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;marc-marot&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:17:22&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2021-10-19 12:00:53&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Marc Marot&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Digital artist Marc enjoyed a successful career as a record executive before joining forces with oil painter Scarlett Raven to create their groundbreaking World War One project, &lt;em&gt;The Danger Tree&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;banner_id&quot;:6980,&quot;meta_title&quot;:null,&quot;meta_description&quot;:&quot;Following a successful music management career, record executive and visual artist Marc Marot has forged a creative partnership with painter Scarlett Raven.

X-ray is a discovery; it\u2019s like a forensic investigation into the subject, showing what it\u2019s really made of.&quot;,&quot;quote_image1_id&quot;:20809,&quot;quote_image2_id&quot;:20810,&quot;quote_image3_id&quot;:20811,&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/youtu.be\/IwN4BRnnJxs&quot;,&quot;video_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;As a struggling freelance photographer, Nick was asked by his then-girlfriend, a designer for the TV show &lt;em&gt;The Big Breakfast&lt;\/em&gt;, to X-ray a Pepsi can. The resulting image sparked an idea that he has explored for over 25 years.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the floral radiographs of the photographer and dental scientist Albert G. Richards, he has X-rayed everything from Christmas trees to the fashion designs of Alexander McQueen. Most famously, Nick created a life-size rendition of a Boeing 777 jet airliner using over 1,000 separate X-rays, which subsequently featured on the side of a hangar for United Airlines.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Invisible to the human eye, high-energy electromagnetic radiation is a dangerous but ethereal medium. Nick&amp;rsquo;s lyrical imagery is created using machines used for medicine and industrial radiography. Nestled in a lead-lined chamber in the Kent countryside, he penetrates the surface to take viewers on a journey to a dimension otherwise hidden and unseen.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Along with working with prestigious brands like Porsche, BMW, Levi&amp;rsquo;s and Nike, Nick has exhibited worldwide and featured in publications including &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;\/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Independent. &lt;\/em&gt;He also appeared on television for the BBC, NBC and Discovery Channel.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nick says: &amp;ldquo;My art is something people can connect with. It&amp;rsquo;s real, it&amp;rsquo;s not hypothetical and complicated &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s instant. You can see how things and connect and tell a story. It&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;ve blinked and the world has tipped into X-ray.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Nick Veasey &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;In a process he likens to &amp;ldquo;putting together a jigsaw&amp;rdquo;, Nick dismantles objects and places them on a lead surface with film behind it. The X-rays pass through the subject, with dense areas absorbing the most radiation and appearing brighter onscreen. To combat the lethal levels of radiation, Nick wears a lead apron and controls the exposure time in a separate room. His skeleton figure is clad in a pressurised rubber suit and is also used in a teaching hospital.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike medical X-rays, which typically use around 100 kilovolts and last 0.2 seconds, Nick&amp;rsquo;s command an impressive 200 kilovolts and can take up to 20 minutes. Once this is complete, the film is processed and scanned before he digitally layers the images to create a startling 3D effect. A motorcycle comprises around 60 X-rays, while a car uses 500!&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nick says: &amp;ldquo;We live in a world obsessed with image&amp;hellip;what we look like, what our clothes look like, houses, cars. I like to counter this obsession with superficial appearances by using X-rays to strip back the layers and show what it is like under the surface.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:20817,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:20818,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;NVE&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:20807,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:80,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;nigel-mason&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:59&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-09-20 16:08:28&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nigel Mason&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Nigel&amp;rsquo;s art is inspired by his childhood in 1950s Yorkshire.

Throughout this time, he drew for pleasure, occasionally selling the odd painting for a few pints.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The artist gleans inspiration from film, photographs, field sketches and live animals. Living only two miles away from a wildlife park, he can often be found visiting their newest additions. He is also moved by the texture, shape and form of rocks and trees, often using this to create the foreground or background of his pieces.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After sketching out his initial ideas, Peter decides on a composition. This will be drawn out full-size before being transferred onto the paper on which the final image will be drawn. Using a monochrome palette, he captures the vibrancy of the animal by altering the pressure and speed of his graphite pencil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Peter says: \&quot;In terms of technique, I have a limited vocabulary. There is a pure essential line, a shade, and a texture produced by the repetition of the line, creating basic building blocks that can be&amp;nbsp; manipulated.

Andy photographs the emerging artwork, with the strongest images subtly retouched to enhance the vibrancy.

This is created by rendering an image into a 3D form and wrapping it with a texture or pattern before running it through several transitions.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Richard says: &amp;ldquo;My work is experimental and playful and is not constrained by a single discipline.

He let us in on a couple of insider tips and inspirations, including - rather unexpectedly - Mickey Mouse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a graphic designer, the artist has experience in animation, 3D drawings, television graphics and illustration. During his time studying at the Chelsea College of Arts, he actually veered away from print design and chose to base his final-year project on a clay sculpture. His work today, he says, is &amp;ldquo;in between film animation, sculpture and graphics &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s something you can&amp;rsquo;t quite put a label on&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Describing his work as a mixture of pop art and Op art, Richard is particularly intrigued by the potential of an image to transform through flat colour and geometric shapes. The polygonal mesh he creates forms a 3D representation from a 2D shape &amp;ndash; creating something entirely new. His&amp;nbsp;interest in cartoons was sparked during his time as a student in Hampstead Heath. A local shop displayed the infamous &amp;lsquo;Mickey Mouse&amp;rsquo; print created by Andy Warhol in 1981, and he became fascinated with the power of imagery and patterns. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: &amp;ldquo;I love looking at patterns &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s in wallpapers, or a wacky interior design. I find it mesmeric, and enjoy the ordered, graphic elements. I especially like the work of Andy Warhol, who repeated patterns within his work. Stripes give a piece energy, as the viewer&amp;rsquo;s eyes follow them across the image.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:6455,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:6912,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;RLE&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:16020,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:87,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;rob-hefferan&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:17:04&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2019-04-30 16:07:29&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rob Hefferan&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Rob&amp;rsquo;s sumptuous paintings celebrate human expression.

Rob, who once worked in advertising with brands such as the BBC and Volkswagen, draws much of his inspiration from the Pre-Raphaelite movement. He uses brushstrokes to create an atmospheric backdrop and a harmony between colour, light and texture.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The startling realism and inner radiance gives Rob&amp;rsquo;s work a photographic quality. He recreates the poetry of skin&amp;rsquo;s tone and structure, paying homage to the complex interaction of musculature, tissue and bone. Like the Pre-Raphaelites, he draws out the painting very accurately and completes a section each day.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rob says: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;For me to just paint what I see is dull; the real skill is to paint what exists only in your imagination and add these elements to the final paintings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Rob Hefferan &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a taste of what the painter has been up to recently!

He briefly attended college before travelling to Stockholm, where he painted portraits on the street. There, he was spotted by a fellow artist who helped him to forge a career creating music videos with the Grammy Award-winning Swedish film director Jonas &amp;Aring;kerlund, who has worked with stars like Madonna.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He now relates his career as a visual effects artist back to his observational artistic style. His nostalgic scenes evoke the sense of flicking through a sketchbook, with Samuel preferring to work from studies rather than reference photography as it &amp;ldquo;keeps the work looser and truer\&quot;. He adds: &amp;ldquo;The human eye is essentially a 35mm lens.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Samuel made it to the finals of the Sky Arts Landscape Artist of the Year competition, which pushed him to pursue a professional art career. His debut collection with Castle Fine Art, &lt;em&gt;Street Life&lt;\/em&gt;, sees him capture Birmingham&amp;rsquo;s iconic waterways, streets and landmarks, taking viewers on a voyage of discovery around the UK&amp;rsquo;s second city.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Samuel Hencher&quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Samuel has developed a technique of applying multiple layers to his oil paintings to create a slightly mottled finish. Mastery of the space within each scene, along with a virtuosity of touch, allows him to draw through the light as his focal point. He adds: \&quot;Light is allowed to take centre stage and play a key role.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his free style, Samuel says: \&quot;My aim is to convey a feeling or emotion that the viewer can relate to without worrying too much about&amp;nbsp; the actual subject of the painting. I paint very quickly without the aid of photos as a reference, using sketches made in situ and memory to achieve a looser, less laboured effect.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:null,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:24767,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:24768,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;SHE&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:24762,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:1,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:32,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;sarah-graham&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:14&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2018-09-14 13:33:56&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sarah Graham&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Sarah made her artist debut at an exhibition she organised in the empty floors above the pub where she worked.

His own tale began with a working-class childhood in 1970s Liverpool, where money was scarce, but memories could be made for free. Peppered with touching anecdotes, this humorous series of original works takes viewers inside the local pub, into the boxing ring and through a narrative that weaves real life with the imaginary.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Completely self-taught, the former IT engineer works mainly in oils for his figurative and portrait paintings. Cubist elements include geometric shapes, bold statement colours and a simplicity of facial structure that makes every character &amp;ndash; from a space-hopping policeman to a sausage dog surrounded by his favourite toys &amp;ndash; instantly relatable. No matter our age or background, we can recognise ourselves and become a part of the story.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Situational humour and heartwarming moments of human interaction are shaped by the intersectional lines, which draw the viewer&amp;rsquo;s eyes around the piece. Stephen derives his full palette from just five colours; inspired by Impressionist painters like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Joaqu&amp;iacute;n Sorolla, Pierre Adolphe Valette and L.S. Lowry, he mixes colours to create the illusion of light and shadow. Further inspirations include the American realist painter Edward Hopper and the Old Masters of the Renaissance, such as Caravaggio, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An avid people-watcher, Stephen draws upon real-life memories and experiences &amp;ndash; including his friends and family, and time spent living in France and Switzerland. Each painting takes up to two months to complete, and is part of an intimate emotional connection between the artist and his creation. Whether his paintings make you laugh, smile or roll your eyes in recognition, they will ultimately make you feel and remember life beyond the canvas.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen&#039;s collection is &lt;a title=\&quot;Shop Stephen Roby&#039;s debut collection\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/original-art-by-stephen-roby\&quot;&gt;now available&lt;\/a&gt; and is on display at &lt;a title=\&quot;Stephen Roby&#039;s collection is on display at selected galleries\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/original-art-by-stephen-roby\&quot;&gt;selected galleries&lt;\/a&gt;.

He adds: &amp;ldquo;I block-paint everything in, and then add the outline later. It gives a brilliant effect.&amp;nbsp;I learned to use just five paints and create every spectrum of colour that you can get with only these.&amp;nbsp;From the dark ground to the medium-coloured layers and the tints at the top, it&amp;rsquo;s the same paints.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Stephen&#039;s intersecting lines also allow viewers to explore the narrative of the artwork. He explains: \&quot;Composition-wise, I&amp;rsquo;ve read tonnes of books on the rule of thirds, and the positioning of irregular shapes to create hidden indicators and draw the eye to certain positions. Now I know that just by the contrast and colour of the diagonal lines, you can draw attention to a focal point in the painting.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more behind-the-scenes news from our artists&#039; studios, subscribe to our &lt;a title=\&quot;Subscribe to our YouTube channel\&quot; href=\&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/castlegalleries\/featured\&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;\/a&gt; or read our &lt;a title=\&quot;Read our Studio Sessions feature in Fine Art Collector\&quot; href=\&quot;https:\/\/online.flippingbook.com\/view\/10982579\/84-85\/\&quot;&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/a&gt; feature in the latest issue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;studio_video_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jtlSPxVhWh8&quot;,&quot;studio_video_id&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author&quot;:null,&quot;studio_quote_author_title&quot;:null,&quot;featured_art_1_media_id&quot;:35344,&quot;featured_art_2_media_id&quot;:35345,&quot;code&quot;:&quot;SRO&quot;,&quot;twitter_handle&quot;:null,&quot;facebook_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;google_plus_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;instagram_profile_url&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;archived&quot;,&quot;hero_id&quot;:35336,&quot;originals_status_id&quot;:2,&quot;video_overlay_id&quot;:null},{&quot;id&quot;:35,&quot;status_id&quot;:2,&quot;display_order&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;stephen-simpson&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2018-08-30 18:16:17&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2022-08-18 08:19:04&quot;,&quot;deleted_at&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Stephen Simpson&quot;,&quot;bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nature and organic forms, Stephen&amp;rsquo;s expert use of heavy texture and high-gloss finish blurs the boundary between 2D art and 3D sculpture.

For his self-described &amp;ldquo;contemporary take on a classical subject&amp;rdquo;, he experiments with a range of styles and compositions. From smaller square paintings to large-scale panoramic works, his art is an exhilarating tour of the botanical wonders of nature.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Roses, poppies, daisies, hibiscuses and sunflowers are all depicted in a spectrum of different colours, including bold primary tones and delicate pastel shades. Often chosen by collectors for a wedding or anniversary gift, his romantic scenes feature bouquets, along with earthy landscapes and intricate details of petals.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his new &lt;a title=\&quot;Discover Opus by Stephen Simpson\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/blog\/stephen-simpson-opus-a-decade-in-the-making\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opus&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/a&gt; collection, he says: \&quot;I wanted to provoke a sense of hope and give it an all-round uplifting feeling by using bursts of colour and texture. We&amp;rsquo;re all living through testing times, and I want to spread some positivity. I hope to make people smile when they see the collection, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be happy &amp;ndash; everyone deserves to be happy.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Artistic inspirations include the French modernist painter &amp;Eacute;douard Manet and the pioneering American artist Georgia O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe. Stephen is also fascinated by how the English Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner managed to create the illusion of light. Drawn to the landscapes and coastlines of northeast England, he can be moved to create a new painting by the embers of a fire or a storm at sea.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Stephen says: &amp;ldquo;I want people to smile when they see the work. I want them to be happy. I want to evoke an emotional response, like when you receive flowers in real life. Everyone can relate to floral paintings on some level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=\&quot;Discover original art by Stephen Simpson\&quot; href=\&quot;..\/..\/..\/art\/q\/~\/artists\/Stephen_Simpson\/statuses\/In_Stock\&quot;&gt;Discover Stephen&#039;s latest original mixed media artworks here&lt;\/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;related_artists_explanation&quot;:null,&quot;inspiration_image1_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image2_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image3_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image4_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration_image5_id&quot;:0,&quot;inspiration2_bodytext&quot;:null,&quot;featured_collection_id&quot;:117,&quot;studio_title&quot;:&quot;Inside the world of Stephen Simpson &quot;,&quot;studio_subtitle&quot;:null,&quot;studio_bodytext&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Stephen works from his studio in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, where he is often inspired by his local landscape.&amp;nbsp;He introduces incredible luminosity to his work by setting fire to his finished canvasses with a blow torch (don&amp;rsquo;t try this at home!) for a crystal-clear finish. For his upcoming collection, Stephen experimented with new styles and techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;He explains: &amp;ldquo;Before, I&amp;rsquo;d use a modelling paste to add the heavy 3D texture to my work, but now I&amp;rsquo;ve changed that for a super-heavy acrylic gel, which has a much more painterly texture. This works a lot better on canvas than modelling paste; in essence, it&amp;rsquo;s a thick acrylic paint without any pigment. I then add the colour to it before applying with a palette knife.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;The acrylic underpainting &amp;ndash; a base layer for the next layers of paint &amp;ndash; is coated in oil paint to soften some sections and add detail to others. I now coat my work in a high-gloss oil varnish rather than resin. Because I&amp;rsquo;m working on canvas rather than board, I found that the resin covered up a lot of the more detailed, textural aspects due its viscosity and depth when dry. It&amp;rsquo;s still instantly recognisable as my work, which is something I was conscious of while developing this new style.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you like reading about our artists&#039; studios, don&#039;t miss our regular&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Studio Sessions&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;feature in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fine Art Collector&lt;\/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine.
